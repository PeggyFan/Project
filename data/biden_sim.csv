But the Bushes ceased being that way in 1992, after Bill Clinton beat the family patriarch.

Sanders is an FDR Democrat.Social Democracy Is 100% American democracy is 100 percent American. We may be latecomers to recognizing a universal right to health care (indeed, we are not quite there yet). But we were first in creating a universal right to public education, in endowing ourselves with ownership of national parks, and, for that matter, in conferring voting rights on males without property and abolishing religious tests for holding national office.“Aren’t we, as the talking heads tell us, a center-right nation?“Well, no, we are emphatically not. And it is regrettable that by swallowing this myth, the present leadership of the Democratic Party, embodied in the Democratic National Committee has, in election after election, shrunk from some of the party’s best traditions in order to keep up in the race for campaign cash, even to the extent of marginalizing and openly scorning what is described as its ‘left wing.’“That Sanders, given his background, is garnering huge crowds who shout his name with an enthusiasm reminiscent of the heyday of the People’s Party in the 1890s, radiates a special glow. Americans may once again be remembering who they are and what they need to do to recapture a government now in thrall to the Money Power. And that ain’t extreme. It’s fundamentally American.”",0.0,Virginia,348,0.183531746032,1,1,0.5,VA,0.369047619048,1,1,0.5,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/us/politics/hillary-clintons-team-is-wary-as-bernie-sanders-finds-footing-in-iowa.html,,,2015-07-06 13:03:34,37.768,-78.2057,59813027.0

And he is demanding that regular Americans get a say in how our society is run, which, despite being the basis for our political system, is no longer the interest of so many of our political leaders. Our lives as individuals are organized based on the needs not of society as a whole but of powerful market actors. We don't have vacation time, maternity/paternity leave, affordable healthcare, because these powerful groups say it will hurt them. The people who hold the most sway over culture, our food, our environment, and increasingly, our education system, rarely care about the public good.

Children learn to accept the government enforced inequality that increases the housing values of one community and the tax rates in the other.The southern “wall” Mr. Trump, and too many others, want to build is just another form of zoning that makes it difficult for the poor but does not prevent the free movement of the middle class. When visitors overstay their welcome in the U.S., the “wall” is properly understood as folly. Why sneak in when you can visit and not go home? Some want a powerful political message that “your kind” is not wanted. Just try to buy or even rent in one of Mr. Trump’s neighborhoods. He does not design and build integrated communities.Ironically, the Trumpian approach is as appealing to wealthy Democrats as it is to wealthy Republicans. The poor can only be accepted if they know their place, follow the rules and idolize wealth with all available government policy.

The shear size of the illegal workforce and its willingness to work for lower wages than most domestic workers, presents a significant drag on domestic wages at the low end of the scale. Because illegals do not have any status, they often choose not to assimilate, which will lead to further troubles down the road as we have to cope with ""foreign cities"" within our US cities.

The problem isn't that evangelicals have lost their values, but that they never had them in the first place.

Perfect example is Kim Davis. She's a hero because she refused to marry gay people, citing the Bible. However she herself doesn't live by the law of the Bible (thrice divorced, etc). The real reason she doesn't want to marry gay people is because giving rights and a voice to the historically disenfranchised chips away at her own privilege - it's a zero sum game, to people like her.

It didn't work because there were a lot of moderate Democrats for the war in Vietnam.  One professor I had claimed that there will never be any Liberal leadership.  McCarthy and McGovern came close, but no cigar.  Bernie Sanders is in that fine Liberal tradition.As you explain, Hillary Clinton represents that vast trove of moderate voters.  They are liberal in the sense that the GOP brands them liberal, but the GOP drops the ball when they fail to understand that there *has* been a ""Reagan realignment"", but that realignment really started with Jimmy Carter.  The moderate Democrat is a tad more conservative (again, despite the screaming and yelling on Fox News to the contrary).  He or she has a sense ""not to go too far"" which is why it is the *Right* that has pulled too far to the extreme.  It's the Right that has caused the polarization in this country.  They disdain moderation.The fact of the matter is that both the Left and the Right are in the ""moderation predicament"".  Ted Cruz can't get far with inflammatory rhetoric, equally as can't Huckabee, Santorum and the other true believer candidates, thus Jeb Bush is claiming that he is the one to win on the national scale.I'll bet you a beer at Heartland that it's a Bush-Clinton race.

If you spent time with me we would disagree, but I would still welcome you into my home and try to show you love.   There are those of us in the Christian world who believe the Bible is inerrant, and try to fulfill all of it as well as we can with God's help.  One of God's greatest calls to us is that of hospitality, or love to the outsider, even those outside of our views.  Many of us will continue to strive to live this out until God returns, even to those who hate our views.   I pray that someone will come into your lives who will change your view on us, even if you don't change your beliefs.

45404,13962,Biden,Lexington,So the GOP establishment wants to win the election by electing a guy to the left of Romney?  Like Bush?  5 million conservative voters stayed home last election because of Romney.  It's time for a non lawyer non politician to send 10s of thousands of government employees packing.

45442,14000,Biden,Ms,"The world has changed and for the worse, since the early days of immigration, when we welcomed the millions from Europe that are us now.  Here in this edition, on the front page, you chronicle the mass, almost uncontrollable flight from Africa, fleeing violence, starvation and economic ruin.  This is not just a weekend phenomenon.  It looks like our right hand is completely ignorant of what the left hand is doing.  Trump is using hyperbole to get attention, but there is plenty of real truth there in the insistence that our present immigration policies and lack of border control are hurting the middle-class of our country now and not enough is being done about it.  No doubt there is a core of opinion among real citizens- regardless of geographic origin- that understands the need to respond to a changing world with tougher policies.  It's a late wake-up call.
