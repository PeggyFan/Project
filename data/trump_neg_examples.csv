0,"Trump's ""rejection"" of Republican policies is exaggerated.  At this point, he's objected to reduced tax rates for carried interest income on the part of hedge fund guys (which most rank and file Republicans probably have no objection to) and to reduction of Social Security and Medicare benefits (and perhaps only for current beneficiaries).  If the Republican Party hasn't become a religion rather than a political party, it would--as it did 30 years ago--accept some diversity of viewpoint, in which case there would be nothing remarkable about Trump's array of opinions.And, by the way, the Democratic Party allows for much more diversity and variation than does the Republican Party.  Virtually every Republican member of Congress lives in abject fear of being primaried if he or she departs from the reservation even a little bit.  At this point, the party is ruled by an unholy alliance of the Club For Growth and the Tea Party faction.Trump is no third party candidate type.  What he is is a demagogue in the making, whose style has captured the imagination of a meaningful minority of a minority party--mostly what we euphemistically refer to as ""low information"" voters (if they are even voters at all)."
1,"The discussion of immigration and illegal immigrants has become muddled because media such as the NY Times don't clearly distinguish when someone is referring to immigrants or illegal immigrants.  The fact that the NYT won't even acknowledge the phrase ""illegal immigrant"" leaves me adding in the word ""illegal"" in their immigration articles and op-ed's whether that addition is accurate or not.  Trump is a nut, but Edsall leaves me unsure whether the concerns of whites and Republicans have to do with immigrants or illegal immigrants.  There's a big difference."
2,Watching a debate with Bush and Clinton would be like watching paint dry. Jeb is looking like he would have a tough time walking and chewing bubble gum. Jeb is having a tough time not being the brightest star in the room. I think Trump is either going to make Jeb step up his game or take his ball and go home. Trump is exposing the dead wood in the race. Clinton would be served having someone like Trump force her to step up her game. I would rather watch grass growing than watch Jeb or Hillary.
3,"Ted Cruz is afraid of Donald Trump. If he says anything against the Donald, the Donald will fire right back and ask for Ted's birth certificate. "
4,It is hard to see what ties Bernie Sanders to either Trump or Carson.  Sanders appeal is not to new ideas but to ideas that have long been at the center of what Democrats want.
5,Fox News was the perfect venue for last week's debate.  They are the masters of vitriolics and they got a dose of their own medicine. I have to admit that it got just a little too hot for them to handle. Fox News and The Republican Party are now distancing themselves from Mr. Trump and the fissure is getting larger. They are now very worried that Mr. Trump will leave and take his angry voters with him. Bon voyage Mr. Trump!  Please take your loyal friends Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Cruz with you. 
6,"I'm sorry, but Trump was correct in asking Ramos to wait his turn.  Ramos kept yelling out questions while another reporter was talking to Trump, which is very rude. If Ramos had played by the rules, he would have been much more effective. Actually, in this case, Ramos was the bully, trying to take over and control the news conference."
7,"Why express any horror on Trump's stupid sayings on Kelly. He is only a reflection of Republican misogynistic attitudes against women anyways.  When Trump was uttering derogatory things about Rosie O'Donnell and other women, I am sure many of the Republican men and women were cheering him.  Now he attacking one of their own, and that too a Fox news icon and thus umbrage.  We blame men in the middle-east on their treatment of women. We have excellent examples in the Republican party and their war on women."
8,"Trump speaks for the lowest common denominator, most of whom who think of themselves as ""Patriots"" or real Americans. His followers are those who believe they have been shorted by the ""ruling class of politicians."" They really believe someone like Trump can bring the government around to their way of thinking. Trump has found a class of people for his followers to hold responsible for their failure to achieve ""The American Dream."" Just listen to this segment of the public. They are angry, they want to get rid of those immigrants taking their American jobs, overloading their schools, getting welfare at their expense, they want a scapegoat for their problems and Trump gives it to them.Just look back and notice where we have seen this kind of rhetoric before. Here it was the Irish, the Chinese, the Italians. In Europe it was the Jews, Gypsy's, and non Aryans. Follow a prejudice and you will find a Trump follower. They do not like politicians, because real politicians have to make compromises, and as the saying goes, you can't please all of the people all of the time, or even some of them any time. The media gives him publicity because it sells, it brings viewers to the channel, or the column just like it has here, giving us all a place to vent, looking for others to agree with us. He will not get the GOP nomination, but his supporters will find some conspiracy theory to tell us why. It is hard to argue with smart people, but futile to argue with fools."
9,"Here's the irony folks.After the 2012 Presidential Election, the establishment GOP went on a nationwide apology tour, promising GOP donors and state officials a new, more inclusive GOP.Trump has accomplished something magical. He is tracking the GOP to the moderate-center on the wedge issues that hurt the GOP every presidential election, while holding the Conservative base by taking a hard line on illegals.It's Trump who is expanding the GOP, and uniting the Conservative base. At the same time.  Proof positive of this? Last week's belly crawl to Trump Towers to mend fences by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.If the GOP double crosses Trump, who will likely win the delegates to be nominated, and picks Jeb, the GOP will implode and go the way of the Whig party in the 1850s.  There's too much money and power at stake for that. The RNC will figure it out and a Trump coronation will take place at the GOP convention, or a funeral for the GOP as we know it."
