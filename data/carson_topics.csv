0,77,bush cruz rubio paul trump,"Your view of who ""won"" the debate largely depends on your party affiliation. The Right like the hard-line positions of Cruz, Fiorina, Walker, Huckabee and Rubio. The Left (most NYT readers) like no one. Independents (which I am) like the more moderate thoughtful positions of Kasich, Bush, Carson, Paul and Christie. And then there are the people only tuning in for entertainment. They like Trump. Idiots!",54,dr carson poor government just,"Dr. Carson is a fine doctor; one of the best.  That skill does not, however, make him a fine politician.  Dr. Carson has never even held a political office.  Dr. Carson is the guy Republicans use as a message to America:  see, we're not bigots; that's not why we hate Obama."
1,107,president obama dr carson experience,"Oh my goodness! I am listening to Rush going on and on about Dr. Carson, someone most people never heard of until the prayer breakfast where Dr. Carson according to the right ""took it to"" Obama and insulted him. They now think he, a neurosurgeon is more qualified to be President than Obama and the left are scared to death of him. Seems they forget that President Obama won't be running in 2016, for one. But more importantly Dr. Carson is a neurosurgeon, brillant by all accounts but just because the right thinks he insulted President Obama, that is supposed to qualify him to be President? WOW!!!!!",46,sanders bernie trump brooks senator,"""These four anti-party men have little experience in the profession of governing.""Bernie Sanders has ""little experience""? Being a mayor of Burlington, Vt (and turning it from a backwater to what it has become), US Representative, and current senator (2nd term). To compare him to Palin, Carson and Trump is ridiculous. Oh, wait, ""Bernie Sanders is a socialist independent, who in the Senate caucuses with the Democrats."" Now I get it."
2,64,tax 10 people pay 000,"Hmmmmm...you make $20,000, have a kid and live in the NY area, you ""put in' 10% or 2,000 DOLLARS, $166 A WEEK, so that people like Carson, that are multi millionaires, can feel better about paying their taxes? They're already paying taxes on purchases and Carson wants to add to that burden on poor families. That's assinine. ""Most people could pay most of their medical bills through health savings accounts."" Really? Will they buy houses, cars, take vacations, etc., too? How do you pay $300,000+, for a serious illness, from any savings account if you have a regular job and aren't a brain surgeon?He says the intent of taxes is to ""hurt"" the rich. I challenge him to find that motivation stated in any speech by any American politician. How does increasing tax rates less than 10% ""hurt"" those who already have more than they can spend in a lifetime? Is this guy REALLY a Christian? The idea that the rich should pay a greater share is simple. Willie Sutton said it: That's where the money is. They will feel it less and benefit the most. Taking money out of the hands of lower and middle class people, who, if you think about it, are the ones who drive the economy because there are so many of them, doesn't seem likely to stimulate the ecnonomy. Carson is a Christian fanatic who says that if we impose dicta from the Bible, except the ones about wealth and the poor, everything will be ok. That's silly. He has a surgeon's ego. That's a good thing to have, in surgery.",65,black party white republican gop,Dr. Carson has a Obama proem with the GOP base: he's Black.  A few years ago the GOP elected a Black man s their Party Chairman.  He lasted less then a year I think before the white supremacists had him removed.  He has been and from since
3,31,climb flaming said liberal success,Quote:  Dr. Carson said he was a “flaming liberal” in college but became conservative through his own climb to success.Translation: I've got mine.,19,students high junior far right,"Thank you New York Times for your insightful commentary on this debate! However, there were numerous false comparisons to the behavior of Junior High school students. We give students far too little credit. Most junior high students who would debate in such an environment would have been far more realistic and respectful, and generally much better prepared for this eerie stage than these ""first string"" Republicans, save perhaps Kasich and Paul. Carson, Trump, Bush, Fiorina and Christie were a colossal disappointment as well. Cruz, Huckabee and Rubio lived up to their respective right-wing idiocies. Harry Reid was right. ""They're all losers"".If the candidates were covered in 50 feet of sand they couldn't have buried their heads any deeper than they did last night in front of Air Force One. Hopefully, that will be as close as they ever get to it!"
4,76,science evolution scientist gay carson,"Happy to see you back Gail!My only comment to an otherwise hilarious and to-the-point OpEd, is that you give way too much credit to Carson by calling him a scientist. He is a brain surgeon  and a successful one, but his work does not entail work that a scientist would do. He probably took science courses, like biology (before evolution was a viable part of it), chemistry and health related topics like  radiology, immunology, etc. But it is probably doubtful that he ever did serious research in these fields (not that these would lead to his antievolutionary believes). I would further wager, that if he rejects evolution, he also refutes the overwhelming evidence of the origin of earth, the solar system and the universe, all contrary to biblical revelations. For to accept those origins critically you need extensive background in physics, astronomy, geophysics, geology and paleontology among other disciplines. What is striking with Carson and his ilk is that they accept the science and technology that allowed their career successes, but deny the findings of science branches that do not support their innate, faith-based believes. That alone disqualifies him as a scientist. And because of his intrinsic mistrust in science base knowledge, a consequence of uncritical thinking typical of the GOP presidential hopefuls, also disqualifies him as president in this evermore science and technology based world.   ",9,kasich vis biggest huckabee times,"Biggest winner: John Kasich. Kasich could essentially argue that he'd accomplished more in Ohio that Scott Walker claims to have done in Wisconsin, but without throwing workers and the poor under the bus. Kasich might have slipped momentarily, however, when in answer to LGBT questions he mentioned a notion novel to current Republicans: Unconditional love. It played well to a ""home crowd,"" but he didn't appear harsh enough to win many Tea Party votes.Biggest losers: Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. At times Carson seemed intent upon proving that, when discussing anything other than neurosurgery, he's no 'brain surgeon.' Most disappointing was his response as to whether he would resume water boarding. How does someone constrained by the Hippocratic Oath to ""do no harm"" fail to profess an aversion to torture in prisoner interrogations? He also seemed to think the U.S. military -- still 18 times the size of whomever occupies second place -- is too small.Huckabee complained that there aren't enough air-worthy B-52s, which could also be argued regarding the B-17 and Curtiss Jenny. Huckabee continued an Elmer Gantry-esque pretense that he is a friend of Israel, although responses vis-a-vis both foreign and domestic policy seethed with systemic undercurrents of -- I didn't coin this term -- Christo-Fascism.Perhaps the best foreshadowing of the debate was an MSNBC shot of ten empty wooden podia. With nothing for scale behind them, they resembled a semi-circle of outdoor lavatories!"
5,55,right wing win ben mainstream,"The difference between the Ben Carson right wing of the Republican party and the so called ""mainstream"" wing is miniscule.  They are both off the rails.",23,tax 10 flat wealth billion,"It is clear to me that the candidates are most inept when it comes to tax reform. The ""pundits and political professionals"" and debate questioners are even worse.For more than 20 years the share of family wealth has declined for all except the richest 10%. The estate tax is the main tax that applies in a significant way to all the rich and just the rich. Candidates Bush, Cruz, Gilmore, Huckabee, Jindal, Paul, Rubio and Santarum want the Estate tax to be eliminated. Ironically, the poorer half of the population (62 million families) collectedly have lost about 70% of their family wealth and now share just 1% of the wealth. Young adults from this group can no longer afford to marry or make babies.As a policy matter many believe that the government does not need the $30 billion a year in estate taxes yet this amount could double the wealth of the poorer half of the population if used to reduce taxes on low income workers ($600 billion over 20 years).If any candidate wants to reduce or eliminate estate taxes and has no plan to restore half the population to at least a 3 or 4% share of family wealth the candidate is obviously promoting inequality.Mr. Carson has little training and is understandably clueless on tax reform. He would be better off proposing a biblical 4% flat tax on wealth rather than a contrived 15% flat tax on income (and keeping the additional 15.3% job killing payroll tax)."
6,55,gop carson great dr ben,"The article never answers the questions posed in the title... Why is he a headache to the GOP?  Why should the GOP try to stop him? I don't believe the GOP is worried about Ben Carson because they already know that they will not nominate  a black man as their frontrunner in a Presidential election.    This was a great article to understand Ben Carson's motivation for running for the GOP nomination, but it missed the boat on showing how he is a threat to the mainstream GOP.",32,ben ross knows know man,"So, here we go again: CNN and The New York Times. To help Clinton Inc., CNN calls a food fight, the Right obliges, untethered by common sense or good taste, with Seven-No-Trump bombast matching the grandiloquence of two examples of what ails us, Chris Christie and Huckabee, the svelte section of the party, seeking refuge in obsequious noise and comparative insanity. And then we have The New York Times born again, Columnist Ross Douthat. This young man knows all. William Safire, move over: Ross wants to make certain that the true believers get a chance to read all about it. Ben Carson offers a hint of what it's like. Ben knows both sides of the tracks. His abilities swamp the field. The man actually accomplished something in his life. He has had a moral purpose for a good long while. Is he a savant? In truth, he is. He knows how bad off we are. He believes God will ultimately help us find the way. Go figure. We've tried most everything else. Think Kennedy, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Inc., Obama. For sheer ambiguity, why not Carson? But get that photograph. Thank Getty Images. As an orthodox agnostic, I have a keen understanding of those that are uncomfortable with Benjamin Solomon Carson Sr., MD. Ben is simply too simple. He is a believer. The Son of God is his savior. Ben is old fashioned... and honest. I know the man. He is a decent guy. Ben Carson cares. He is a father, and a doctor. And he's smart. Our children know. What do we know about Ross Douthat? "
7,83,dr care health insurance carson,"Do Dr. Carson's conservative fans realize that, in ""America the Beautiful"", the ""catastrophic care insurance"" Dr. Carson calls for is government run, tax funded, single-payer catastrophic health care coverage? Or that Dr. Carson then goes on to propose paying for this in part by special taxes on health insurance companies, limits on health insurance company profits, and extremely tight regulation of health insurance company premiums? That Dr. Carson calls for the kind of rigorous, national re-evaluation of end of life costs Conservatives derided as ""death panels""? That Dr. Carson holds up FEMA's role in mitigating the property insurance impact of catastrophes as a model? It's all right there in his book -- and even available in the preview you can read on books.google.com for yourself.  Dr. Carson's plan essentially calls government run single-payer health care for pretty much every American who gets seriously ill -- just about anyone who gets into an auto accident, needs a transplant, gets cancer, etc, would end up falling into the catastrophic bucket. This radically changes the standing assumptions regarding economics of health care, when private insurers know they're only covering the first $300K, when the government can tightly regulate premiums on that first $300K of coverage, and everyone can count on government coverage if they actually get really sick. This is a plan in many ways to the _left_ of Romneycare / ACA. Do Dr. Carson's new Conservative fans even get that?",43,slavery worst thing obamacare worse,Ben Carson called America “very much like Nazi Germany” and Obamacare the worst thing since slavery. And this guy is smart?
8,89,trump sanders brooks bernie political,"Bernie Sanders is the man.  Unlike Trump, he isn't a narcissistic blowhard, but an American who cares about the people and resonates with a huge portion of Americans.  He sees where the wealthy (of whom Trump is so emblematic) have achieved the position of a privileged and protected class, and the middle class has been devoured by greed and complicity. Bernie Sanders makes sense.  Carson and Trump have yet to offer specifics on how they would make a better country, and Sanders has.  He has political experience, and Carson and Trump do not.  Bernie is the man.",55,bush cruz huckabee walker rubio,"Let's see...Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush...this nation's elected those shining examples of mediocrity, so why not a Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee or Chris Christie?"
9,123,black party republicans republican ben,"The Republican candidate who bothers me the most is Ben Carson. He has a tea party mentality and no governing experience and would probably be a worse president than Dubya. Carson has been steadily climbing in the polls and would be a strong candidate who would take a lot of the black vote away from the Democrats. Actually, he is probably the best chance the Republicans have at gaining the presidency and would be a disaster.",140,candidates people mr time like,"The debates were interesting but with out rump to beat on, boring. A lot of the post debate pundits centered on Megyn Kelly and Trump.   They didn't like the way Trump spoke to her. As a moderator, for the most part she gave the other candidates a time to recite their speeches. She tried to come across as a tough questioner but when she asked if one of the candidates would let the mother die rather than let her have an abortion, she let him prance around the question and never answer. She let him off the hook rather than saying, ""this is  a yes or no question, answer the question."" Ben Carson hardly got to speak.  He had things to say and certainly should have been ask about his foreign policy. There were so many lost opportunities. The question about God speaking to them was intruding into their private beliefs. Would she have asked a Muslim or Buddhist the same question. Their answers were good but what we say or feel in our prayers is none of her business. What is important is how their faith would dictate their actions as president on such matters as abortion. She had her chance with the question about letting the mother die, but she never stuck to it. Hopefully the next set of debates will tell us what these candidates stand for and not who likes Trump."
