0,109,46,Bernie Sanders is getting my vote in the Democratic primary - and I hope to get to vote for him again in the general election.,"As a Democrat sick of the Clintons who is NOT voting for Hillary in the primaries, I'd far rather have Bernie Sanders and his principles and progressivism in the White House than Hillary, but given the way the NYT is bound and darned to treat all the other candidates like jokes instead of doing their job to cover the race means it's unlikely he'll get the coverage that he deserves to make it all the way to the nominating convention.  Just because Hillary possesses ovaries doesn't insulate her from poor judgment and a lack of commitment to the leftist values that are important to me.  Symbolism is a terrible reason to vote for someone.  Being worried about the Supreme Court overturning what's left of our civil rights is a more valid reason; why doesn't the Times start asking Hillary about the importance of leftist judges who understand the checks and balances of a federalist system, and focus less on email and obvious gender characteristics?Hillary has female sex organs.  Wow.  Is this a new discovery?  No.  Get over it, move along.  Unless you're writing an expose about the pervasive sexism of the American public.  That's worth 2000 words.  That's not about Hillary, though, and would require thought to make it page-view worthy.How about-- Hillary continues to be inconsistent on the issues, and doesn't answer questions, here are examples, and here is why we are worried-- all without mentioning Bill Clinton or Hillary's gender even once? _That_would be news. "
1,86,27,Much LOVE to Bernie.,"The reality is, Sanders is one of the few Senators who has the guts to say the truth."
2,278,42,"The mention in the article that Sanders would not appeal to middle-aged people who make more money (and would be afraid of him taxing more of it) is crazy, though I'm sure Clinton and others will try to spin it that way (and it will likely work).I'm sure Sanders is not in favor of taxing the middle class any more, but rather the upper middle class and even more so the rich.I am an upper middle class small business owner. And anyone in my position would do MUCH, MUCH better business-wise if the rich were taxed more and the money was used to support the middle class (like Sanders' idea to tax Wall St to pay higher ed tuition). In this case the middle-income Americans would have more to spend.I'll gladly pay a few thousand more in taxes per year, to make tens of thousands more because the pool of available customers will expand (when the middle class is doing better).Even if you don't have a heart at all or any ethical standards, it is just plain economic sense. Anyone who thinks otherwise is simply not thinking it through (or they own a business that caters to the wealthy).",I'll give Bernie my vote and my time although I know he's got little to no chance of getting the nomination.
3,127,65,"Sanders can win most definitely  win.End negative tribal thought of why he can't win now.Put all your mental energy into ""HE CAN WIN"" IF WE WANT HIM TO.","Dear Gail,Great ideas, but too many jokes here. What would happen if we treated Bernie as a serious candidate? He stands for most everything I care about for this country. I just made a small donation. It reminded me of another candidate who started out on small donations, and he won! Enough cynicism. Let's go with Bernie!"
4,147,32,It's a fact that most Americans agree with Senator Sanders.,"I commend Senator Sanders for his personal integrity and lucidity of argument.  In this ""long speech,"" I think he articulates the frustration and anger of many Americans regarding this issue.The article could be enhanced if the author informed us if any other Senators are working in concert with Senator Sanders, or if this 'profile in courage' is a lone effort."
5,253,37,"I see Bernie Sanders as worthy of support.  Hillary Clinton, not so much.",We need President Sanders very badly. Please let the universe give him to us. 
6,275,48,"This sounds as though it could be effective except for the one issue that will probably make it more of a waste of time than anything else.It doesn't change how Republicans select THEIR candidate.  They are the ones who have consistently destroyed their party's chances because a determined wealthy group of right wing zealots would rather attack their candidates throughout the entire primary process to advance their selfish personal interests than focus on winning the White House.  Their candidate ultimately has to grovel to them and their antiquated views on social issues such as same sex marriage, abortion, income inequality and immigration.  The result is a weak candidate who has changed positions so often in order to get nominated that they have little, if any, credibility left with anyone by the end of the convention.Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren will effectively lead, and keep, Hilary to the left on some issues.  But who is going to do that for the Republicans, lead them to the more reasonable center?  No-one.  They are already self-destructing months before the first primary and exposing yet another group of weak candidates eager to do and say anything for money.  They form into a circle and start firing.  It's a losing strategy but the one they are stuck with.Hilary may not be completely in line with some traditional Democratic interests but, compared with the eventual Republican candidate, they'll vote for her anyway.","Bernie Sanders will do well in this campaign with PEOPLE OF ALL AGES because he represents ordinary Americans. Sanders has put forth a 12-step common sense plan that deals with the problems facing this country:1. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure2. Reversing climate change3. Creating worker co-ops  and eliminating tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas4. Strengthening labor legislation5. Raising the minimum wage to a living wage6. Pay equity for women7. Trade policies that benefit American workers8. Making college affordable9. Breaking up the big banks10. Medicare for all11. Expanding Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition programs12. Returning to a progressive tax code and eliminating corporate tax loopholesAgenda for America: 12 Steps Forward is the ONLY POLITICIAN (actually Sanders is a statesman), who frequently lands on the front page of Reddit, where the median user is 18-29 years of age according to Google Ad Planner. A group of Sanders’ supporters from Reddit released the following video:Grassroots for Sanders:Bernie Sanders - The President We Need"
7,130,48,Bernie Sanders Right Then And Right Now For America!,"TPP destroys our nation' sovereignty. Who, in their right mind, thinks this is okay to give up our representative government over to multinationals ? People who think it's only about trade are dangerously naive and playing into the hands of the multinationals. Even Doctors Without Borders understand that TPP will cause necessary medical drugs to become exorbitantly too expensive for the poor. The big pharmaceutical companies will price gouge and cause generic drugs to be too costly under TPP. The big pharmaceutical's lobbyists helped write TPP...collusion and illegal comes to mind.  All the multinational lawyers and lobbyists have helped write it and were able to read it in depth...but the American people have been kept in the dark. The media has been guilty of not covering TPP in depth, reminds me of the same lousy coverage of the run up to the Iraq war by the media. The media didn't do it's job then and are failing the American people now !  There is no excuse for Obama to push TPP this hard without the American people's representation. The democrats who voted for this are traitors to the American people. Bernie Sanders stood up against TPP, he knows it will totally destroy our middle class and destroy our sovereignty. Wiithout a middle class our country will have NO DEMOCRACY and other functioning democracies have a middle class. I'm afraid that our country is slipping toward fascism where our government is totally controlled by multinational corporations. Bernie '16 "
8,176,41,If only we had more like Bernie!,"Over the years the Republican party has gone from the party of dirty tricks to cheating to seeking power at any cost while constantly moving to the right, until it a party of billionaires.They have effectively destroyed democracy.  Popular will has given way to the will of billionaires. FDR defined this as fascism. The question in 2016 is whether our freedom can survive a GOP victory.Except to the extent that some are worse than the others it makes no difference who the GOP runs. Not one is qualified for office by experience  or has a vision of the future they dare disclose.  Not so with the Democrats My choice would be Sanders but his chance of election is risky and while the people like him and his program, there is a risk we cannot take that a Republican will get elected on a tidalwave of money and slander.The much slandered and highly qualified Hillary though actually to the left of Obama is the safest bet against having a billionaire controlled pigmy in the White House.  Bill Clinton who, as Republican-lite, cared about people and was extremely well liked, ran the country well, although he signed some awful Republican laws. The Republicans have changed the rules of the game and now complain that Hillary is not only playing by their rules that she is good at it. I want Warren or Sanders but Warren won’t run and Sanders will not play the game an will loose. So I’m rooting for Hillary because she is smarter than any of the Republicans and believes in democracy. "
9,167,53,Bernie Sanders for President and Elizabeth Warren for Vice President would be a winning ticket for the Democratic Party and the Nation.,"Senator Sanders' entry into the race could be extremely valuable for the country and the process-depending, of course, on how the media presents Mr. Sanders, and what the media focus becomes. Will it be the story of what's right and just in terms of opportunity for the average American and income equality? Or, will he be subtly attacked and derided as too far left, or as a socialist?In the by-line on the front page of the digital edition. the Times says he ""will inject a leftist voice into the contest"". Then, in the article, he is referred to as ""injecting a progressive voice into the contest"". So, which is it? Is he a LEFTIST (negative connotation), or is he a PROGRESSIVE VOICE? People will need to demand a well rounded, healthy debate, and fight against the media tendency to follow the leader.  "
