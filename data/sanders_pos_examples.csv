0,Bernie Sanders is getting my vote in the Democratic primary - and I hope to get to vote for him again in the general election.
1,Much LOVE to Bernie.
2,"The mention in the article that Sanders would not appeal to middle-aged people who make more money (and would be afraid of him taxing more of it) is crazy, though I'm sure Clinton and others will try to spin it that way (and it will likely work).I'm sure Sanders is not in favor of taxing the middle class any more, but rather the upper middle class and even more so the rich.I am an upper middle class small business owner. And anyone in my position would do MUCH, MUCH better business-wise if the rich were taxed more and the money was used to support the middle class (like Sanders' idea to tax Wall St to pay higher ed tuition). In this case the middle-income Americans would have more to spend.I'll gladly pay a few thousand more in taxes per year, to make tens of thousands more because the pool of available customers will expand (when the middle class is doing better).Even if you don't have a heart at all or any ethical standards, it is just plain economic sense. Anyone who thinks otherwise is simply not thinking it through (or they own a business that caters to the wealthy)."
3,"Sanders can win most definitely  win.End negative tribal thought of why he can't win now.Put all your mental energy into ""HE CAN WIN"" IF WE WANT HIM TO."
4,It's a fact that most Americans agree with Senator Sanders.
5,"I see Bernie Sanders as worthy of support.  Hillary Clinton, not so much."
6,"This sounds as though it could be effective except for the one issue that will probably make it more of a waste of time than anything else.It doesn't change how Republicans select THEIR candidate.  They are the ones who have consistently destroyed their party's chances because a determined wealthy group of right wing zealots would rather attack their candidates throughout the entire primary process to advance their selfish personal interests than focus on winning the White House.  Their candidate ultimately has to grovel to them and their antiquated views on social issues such as same sex marriage, abortion, income inequality and immigration.  The result is a weak candidate who has changed positions so often in order to get nominated that they have little, if any, credibility left with anyone by the end of the convention.Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren will effectively lead, and keep, Hilary to the left on some issues.  But who is going to do that for the Republicans, lead them to the more reasonable center?  No-one.  They are already self-destructing months before the first primary and exposing yet another group of weak candidates eager to do and say anything for money.  They form into a circle and start firing.  It's a losing strategy but the one they are stuck with.Hilary may not be completely in line with some traditional Democratic interests but, compared with the eventual Republican candidate, they'll vote for her anyway."
7,Bernie Sanders Right Then And Right Now For America!
8,If only we had more like Bernie!
9,Bernie Sanders for President and Elizabeth Warren for Vice President would be a winning ticket for the Democratic Party and the Nation.
