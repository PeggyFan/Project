0,"If I deeply despise practically everything Trump stands for, why is it I like Donald Trump?  Because compared to his Republican rivals, Trump appears behaving from pure conviction.  Are his ideas infantile, retrograde and ignorant? Absolutely.  But in contrast to his rivals, Trump displays an kind of  ""integrity"" that seems completely lacking in all other Republicans vying for the nomination.  Do I think Trump is an idiot? Yes.  But I respect anyone who speaks his mind unfettered (even a fool), especially when compared to the calculating GOP demagogues who seem all-too-eager to reshape their ideas and attitudes hourly to reflect the latest voter opinion polls.  For me, a vote for Trump is really a vote against political pandering.  Donald Trump is merely pathetic; by contrast, Scott Walker and Jeb Bush are frightening. "
1,How about NO more Bushes and NO more Clintons !!
2,"During the time the Bush tax cuts were more extreme (2003 to 2012) the economy grew at an average rate of 1.76%.  For the 10 previous years the average growth rate was  3.56%.   For the two years after the Bush tax cuts were reduced the average growth rate was 2.12%.    When will this myth of tax cuts = more growth get debunked?  The state of Kansas is another example where tax cuts did not lead to more growth but slower growth and lowering of the credit rating for the state.   Those who promote such policies should be not called ""economists"" but ""apologists"" for the 1% who benefit from such tax cuts."
3,Bush was talking about people that are now working 30 hours or less because of the Obama policies that have made companies cut work hours and put people on part-time work schedules. Krugman is nothing more than an extreme left wing hack. If he had his way our country would be another socialist country. Thank God he has very little influence today. 
4,"Jeb is probably smarter than Dubya, but the family dog was smarter than George. Being ""smarter than his brother is not high praise for Jeb. It just means Jeb is not as stupid as George. He's already stated his primary advisors will be the neocons that convinced Dubya to lie about WMDs and invade Iraq. The entire middle east is on fire thanks to Dubya and Jeb hasn't learned a thing! We cannot have another Bush as POTUS!We cannot have another Bush in the White House. If by chance Jeb is the candidateâ€¦remember what happened when George was POTUS."
5,"Comparing the Bush and Clinton ""dynasties"" as the same is a false equivalency. The Bush's are old money and the Bush boys inherited the political family business. The Clintons do not come from money (and in fact they both come from very humble middle class roots) and zero political connections. Say what you will about Bill and Hillary but they built their political careers and dynasty themselves. And to suggest that Hillary is just coasting on the Clinton name is misdirected. Why? Because Hillary was a force in shaping Bills political ambitions and thus she helped to build the Clinton machine, she was not just along for the ride. And dismissing Hillary's resume is a tired cheap shot that is really quite offensive to all women. It's hard to imagine any man who served two elected terms as a US senator and as SOS being maligned and ridiculed for their experience. We have many one term senators running for president and one in the White House now. What exactly are the accomplishemts of say Rubio or Paul? And yet it is only ever really asked what are Hillary's accomplishements."
6,"The Invasion of Iraq's most critical result was to remove the primary check on Iran, which was defeated in the 1980s war between Iraq and Iran. To  eliminate Saddam Husein because he was an aggressive dictator ran counter to the decades old policy to do business with autocrats around the world, because they were disliked, but they stabilized their country and the US turned a blind eye to their excesses - for reasons of convenience. Saddam kept Iraq under control, while his American supported successors created chaos. Iran was subdued after its war and Iraq kept it in check.   The current non-policies of the Republican presidential candidates results from a perceived need to favor a strong, controlling US stance in the world, but without a rational policy or expounded means to explain how they would achieve that without moving the US into another Mid-Eastern armed conflict.Their policies to date are primarily based on a dislike of Obama and border on the disastrous Bush-Cheney-Wolfowitz Neocon policies. - It is all campaign rhetoric without the need to implement their stands, and they are very short of realistic, pragmatic solutions."
7,Ben Carson seemed lost; Jeb Bush seemed nervous; Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee seemed evil; Scott Walker seemed baked
8,"Ever Since Bush, the GOP base has comprised those that call themselves Evangelicals, Tea Partiers, Family Values people, anti-government activists, and Fiscal Conservatives. Unfortunately, these groups are not necessarily what their titles say they are. In this day and age, the GOP base is not the best informed nor the most open minded of citizens. They are the gun people, the racially biased, the anti-ACA, the anti-immigrants, the climate change deniers, the anti-science people, and those that think the problems in the Middle East can only be solved at the end of gun. They are splintered into various groups clustered in different geographic regions of the country. Each GOP candidate is supported by at least one of these groups and it is they that they speak to. If a Republican wants to get elected, he or she has to appeal to these groups. This means addressing their concerns in a language they can understand - even if offensive to the majority of voters. Once nominated, they change their tune to become more acceptable to the general population. Then with the help of Fox News they hope to generate enough mistrust in the opposing party to overcomes their previous rhetoric. It's a gamble, but the GOP needs the all that are willing to vocalize their views to win. It is these guys that can rally other conservatives to vote for their cause. "
9,"Kasich is certainly a breath of fresh air for Republican voters. However, I dont see the primary going his way in any situation, even if he is able to win the more moderate primary in New Hampshire. Kasich may be standing out in a field of 17, but if it were to come down to two (Bush v Kasich, Walker v Kasich, Paul v Kasich or Trump v Kasich), Kasich would do absolutely horribly. If it comes down to establishment Bush and Kasich, the donor money is going to flow to Governor Bush.  "
