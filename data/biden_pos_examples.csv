3,"TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Biden BidenbernieYeah, right, you haven't ""ignored"" him. But it's a good thing you have commenters, or we wouldn't even have gotten this slight genuflection to the only presidential candidate campaigning for the American people. "
4,"Absolutely Biden should run, and may the best candidate win!  The Democratic Party needs to remember we are still living in a democracy (such as it is)--give us citizens a choice.  Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party elites will not do well to think her ""inevitable.""  All the Democratic candidates (Sanders, Webb., O'Malley, Chafee) and including Biden I hope, should debate.  Hillary did not do very well in 2008 presidential campaign debating against the unknown candidate Obama.  She needs to prove she is the best Democratic candidate, and the experience of debating now can only help to prepare her, if she is the presidential nominee, to take on the Republican candidate."
5,"The prospect of voting for Hillary Clinton is a disturbing one.    There is too much to distrust, too much to cringe at.  Biden would be a much better choice.  I won't vote Republican, but if Hillary Clinton is the nominee I may not mark a vote for the position of President.  "
6,Mr. Biden may be too good a man to be president. 
7,I like Joe and think he has been a great VP but he is too old. I know because he is my age! I am sure the Repb like it however. 
8,"Biden is well liked, which Hillary is not. He is classy, which Hillary is not, He is scandal free, which Hillary is not, he is capable of dealing with the opposition, which Hillary is not, he is true to his word, which Hillary is not.Excellent."
9,"Think about it.   The very thing people criticized Joe Biden for, telling it like it is, is now exactly what Donald Trump is being applauded for.  Who better to give it right back than Joe Biden? This may be Joe Biden's opportunity - to uphold the integrity of what is left of this country, that his son would not have died in vein. Joe Biden can be trusted.  Joe Biden has the experience.  Joe Biden knows the world and the world knows him.  Joe Biden knows the military.  Joe Biden is a family man who is loved and loves back.  Joe Biden knows politics and he knows the politicians and their moves in Congress.  Joe Biden would not be driven by money. More important than anything - Joe Biden cares.  He's not been serving this country for a show, he's done it because he cares.Joe, go for it.  We'll have your back."
