While Ben and Carly are appealing sounding names for candidates,the names can't hide that they have shortcomings that are extrarordinary even for this GOP open air insane asylum.Carson ,The GOP's designated black this time around probably offended most other blacks by comparing Obamacare,from which many of them benefit from,with something as shameful to our nation's past as slavery.As a neurosurgeon he should know from his own profession that it has been scientifically proven thatLBGT people are naturally so,BEFORE birth,so that it's  impossible for men to"" go into prison straight,and come out gay.    Carly disqualifies herself for President by boasting about a business experience at which she was a total failure.In the extremely unlikely event she got elected President,if she did for American jobs what she did at HP, the late Archy Bunker(All In The Family) would finally have long desired ""WOMAN like Herbert Hoover again "" !    But may Carson's candidacy be long into next year,for he'll take the GOP so far to the outer reaches of the fringe,it will likely be a landslide victory for Hillary !"
1,"""These four anti-party men have little experience in the profession of governing.""Bernie Sanders has ""little experience""? Being a mayor of Burlington, Vt (and turning it from a backwater to what it has become), US Representative, and current senator (2nd term). To compare him to Palin, Carson and Trump is ridiculous. Oh, wait, ""Bernie Sanders is a socialist independent, who in the Senate caucuses with the Democrats."" Now I get it."
2,"Biggest winner: John Kasich. Kasich could essentially argue that he'd accomplished more in Ohio that Scott Walker claims to have done in Wisconsin, but without throwing workers and the poor under the bus. Kasich might have slipped momentarily, however, when in answer to LGBT questions he mentioned a notion novel to current Republicans: Unconditional love. It played well to a ""home crowd,"" but he didn't appear harsh enough to win many Tea Party votes.Biggest losers: Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. At times Carson seemed intent upon proving that, when discussing anything other than neurosurgery, he's no 'brain surgeon.' Most disappointing was his response as to whether he would resume water boarding. How does someone constrained by the Hippocratic Oath to ""do no harm"" fail to profess an aversion to torture in prisoner interrogations? He also seemed to think the U.S. military -- still 18 times the size of whomever occupies second place -- is too small.Huckabee complained that there aren't enough air-worthy B-52s, which could also be argued regarding the B-17 and Curtiss Jenny. Huckabee continued an Elmer Gantry-esque pretense that he is a friend of Israel, although responses vis-a-vis both foreign and domestic policy seethed with systemic undercurrents of -- I didn't coin this term -- Christo-Fascism.Perhaps the best foreshadowing of the debate was an MSNBC shot of ten empty wooden podia. With nothing for scale behind them, they resembled a semi-circle of outdoor lavatories!"
3,"Let's see...Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush...this nation's elected those shining examples of mediocrity, so why not a Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee or Chris Christie?"
4,"It is clear to me that the candidates are most inept when it comes to tax reform. The ""pundits and political professionals"" and debate questioners are even worse.For more than 20 years the share of family wealth has declined for all except the richest 10%. The estate tax is the main tax that applies in a significant way to all the rich and just the rich. Candidates Bush, Cruz, Gilmore, Huckabee, Jindal, Paul, Rubio and Santarum want the Estate tax to be eliminated. Ironically, the poorer half of the population (62 million families) collectedly have lost about 70% of their family wealth and now share just 1% of the wealth. Young adults from this group can no longer afford to marry or make babies.As a policy matter many believe that the government does not need the $30 billion a year in estate taxes yet this amount could double the wealth of the poorer half of the population if used to reduce taxes on low income workers ($600 billion over 20 years).If any candidate wants to reduce or eliminate estate taxes and has no plan to restore half the population to at least a 3 or 4% share of family wealth the candidate is obviously promoting inequality.Mr. Carson has little training and is understandably clueless on tax reform. He would be better off proposing a biblical 4% flat tax on wealth rather than a contrived 15% flat tax on income (and keeping the additional 15.3% job killing payroll tax)."
5,"Thank you New York Times for your insightful commentary on this debate! However, there were numerous false comparisons to the behavior of Junior High school students. We give students far too little credit. Most junior high students who would debate in such an environment would have been far more realistic and respectful, and generally much better prepared for this eerie stage than these ""first string"" Republicans, save perhaps Kasich and Paul. Carson, Trump, Bush, Fiorina and Christie were a colossal disappointment as well. Cruz, Huckabee and Rubio lived up to their respective right-wing idiocies. Harry Reid was right. ""They're all losers"".If the candidates were covered in 50 feet of sand they couldn't have buried their heads any deeper than they did last night in front of Air Force One. Hopefully, that will be as close as they ever get to it!"
6,Dr. Carson has a Obama proem with the GOP base: he's Black.  A few years ago the GOP elected a Black man s their Party Chairman.  He lasted less then a year I think before the white supremacists had him removed.  He has been and from since
7,"Dr. Carson is a fine doctor; one of the best.  That skill does not, however, make him a fine politician.  Dr. Carson has never even held a political office.  Dr. Carson is the guy Republicans use as a message to America:  see, we're not bigots; that's not why we hate Obama."
8,"Just to point out an obvious error, Mr. Brooks, you say in your column: ""They have no plausible path toward winning 50.1 percent of the vote in any national election.""Of course, if either Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson gets the Republican nomination and Mr. Sanders gets the Democratic nomination, then it is actually very likely indeed that one of them will get a majority of the national vote.And if the events (and polls) of the past few weeks have failed to convince you that Trump/Carson vs. Sanders in the general election is a plausible scenario, then I would humbly suggest that you are dangerously resistant to evidence that doesn't fit your preconceptions, and are doing the public discourse more harm than good."
9,"Here we go again: CNN, The New York Times. To help Clinton Inc., CNN calls a food fight, the right obliges, untethered by common sense or good taste, with Seven No Trump bombast matching the grandiloquence of two examples of what ails us, Chris Christie and Huckabee, the svelte section of the party, seeking refuge in obsequious noise and comparative insanity. And then we have The New York Times version of a born again, Ross Douthat. This young man knows  all. William Safire, move over: Ross wants to make certain that the true believers get a chance to read all about it. Ben Carson offers a hint of what it's like. Ben knows both sides of the tracks, and his abilities swamp the field. The man actually accomplished something in his life, and he has had a moral purpose of for a good long while. Is he a savant? In truth, he is. He knows how bad off we are, and believes God will ultimately help us find the way. Go figure. We've tried most everything else. Think Kennedy, Nixon, Carter, Clinton, Inc., Obama. For sheer ambiguity, why not Carson? But get that photograph. Thank Getty Images. As an orthodox agnostic, I have a keen understanding of those that are uncomfortable with Benjamin Solomon Carson Sr., MD. Ben is simply too simple. He is a believer. The Son of God is his savior. Ben is old fashioned... and honest. I know the man. His a decent guy. Ben Carson cares. He is a father, and a doctor. And he's smart. The children know. What do we know about Ross Douthat? "
