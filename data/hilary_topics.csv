0,133,president hillary woman america rodham,"Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the MOST QUALIFIED PERSON to be the next President of the United States.  She is smarter, and knows more about politics and the world, than any other person running for the office and most people in the world.  We should have listened to her when she spoke of a vast right-wing conspiracy because it has nearly destroyed OUR democracy.  Ms. Rodham Clinton was a respected attorney when she became First Lady.  According to Wikipedia, ""She cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families in 1977, she became the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978, and became the first female partner at Rose Law Firm in 1979. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America.""  She was on  the front-line when there was a ""conservative"" backlash against women having equal rights in America.  She kept her head and went on to serve as Secretary of State to President Obama after he won the presidency that she sought - because she LOVES America.  And now she is doing us the honor of running for President again and has shown all of us what it is to be a tough, dedicated woman in America.  Every woman who is registered to vote in America MUST vote for her.  If you aren't registered get registered to vote for her.  She is simply the Best!",100,biden joe run president obama,"A Joe Biden run would effectively be a third Obama term. Is America so happy with Obama that they would want a third term? Based on Obama's approval numbers, America seems to be saying no. For the GOP currently confused about how to run against Hillary Clinton, a Biden run makes their job very easy; run against Obama and tie Biden to all the ""bad"" policies of Obama. Biden becomes Obama III. I don't think even many democrats who voted Obama want to see that. "
1,161,email server private state information,"I think the press should cut Clinton some slack on the email issue. Most of us with at least a few years of professional work experience know better than to write any confidential information in text or email forms. We use the phone or meet in person. And that is what Mrs. Clinton did.Hillary Clinton, as a person who has been under constant scrutiny of everybody, knows more than anyone to leave a visible electronic trail.  Most of the email that she sent can probably be reconstructed if it really includes valuable information because all emails  have one or more recipients, and most of those copies are already on the State Department email server and may even be available on numerous public email servers if she sent mail to individual outside the Clinton private server.",149,times story news coverage clinton,"I'm a lukewarm fan of Mrs. Clinton, certainly not a partisan. Yet I found the paragraph by Ms. Sullivan surprising, ""None of this should be used to deny the importance of The Times...""  It reads like an editorial criticism of Mrs. Clinton's e-mail practices rather than part of a Public Editor's critique of news coverage.  For me, it muddled Ms. Sullivan's credibility in this piece.  As for the Times' coverage, I found a clear statement in the Washington Post that no criminal investigation was being considered at the very same time that the Times had a prominent headline implying that such an investigation was indeed being considered.  The Times' headline persisted for several hours when I went back to check.  This episode reinforces my practice of relying on several disparate news sources rather than relying primarily on the Times.   "
2,182,times coverage story ny page,"I don't trust the NY Times political coverage and have not since Trooper-gate, travel-gate and White-water,which was largely the fault of this paper. This e-mail story is just one more NY Times hit piece. I am not a Clintonista but am proud that she can hit the Times back and make it stick. The criticisms of the NY Times hurt because they are true.Maureen Dowd's latest editorial reflects the Time's id, as far as I am concerned.",54,black matter lives blm apology,"Until Charles M. Blow and the ""Black Lives Matter"" activists angrily confront Barack Obama in front of the cameras for what he's failed to do for the Black community the same way BLM is attacking Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton for what they HAVE done to help the Black Community, this movement does not ""matter"" to this Black man. "
3,205,biden joe run clinton president,"Nothing -- well almost nothing -- could make me happier than to have Joe Biden run for president. We don't need another Clinton, and it would be good to have another president I could genuinely and wholeheartedly support. Run Joe, run!",193,sanders bernie support hillary democrat,"Dismissing Bernie Sanders as a socialist, as the main stream media and the Hillary Clinton supporters have already done, or as a crazy is a mistake.  Bernie Sanders's ideas not only make sense to the majority of the American people but he is also the toughest politician which I've seen since LBJ.I changed my voter registration from Independent to Democrat in order to be able to vote for him in the Democratic primary.  When people actually get to listen to Bernie they like him, a lot.  This is shaping up to be 2008 all over again for Hillary and the third way, corporatist DCCC.  The message is loud and clear that Bernie doesn't dance around issues like the TPP ala Hillary.  It is refreshing to see someone emerge with their own ideas as opposed to the latest poll results."
4,293,sanders bernie hillary support clinton,"It would be nice to read an article about Bernie Sanders that is not, in fact, about Hillary Clinton.",85,clintons bushes sick tired barry,"No more Bushes, no more Clintons. "
5,250,trump republican bush gop donald,"As Hillary Clinton continues to remake herself, it makes one wonder if the Democrats needs to seriously consider someone else. It is rather scary, that Donald Trump is the most preferred GOP candidate. Hillary Clinton could actually lose to Donald Trump, because of celebrity recognition. Yes, the US voter is naive enough to play the election like ""Celebrity Apprentice"".  They are doing that right now, in GOP  preferred polls.A ticket of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren is sounding more appealing each day. That may be enough to combat the now 15 Republican seeking office. Out of that 15, Jeb Bush is the most reasonable stand out, the best of the worse one might say.American politics has declined to that no reasonably, intelligent person would choose to run. If they do, they are wrecked by the special interests, PACs and the like. Leaving the election to people like Ted Crizz or a Donald Trump. In a way, the current GOP crowd makes Sarah Palin look somewhat sane. Need I say more?Ms. Clinton has a great deal of ""reintroducing"" to do. To me it is like voting for 4 - 8 years more of the Clinton, George W. Bush  or Obama administration. That is business as usual; more for the oligarchs, more for Wall Street, more war and more decline fro 99% of America. The GOP alternative, makes Ms. Clinton much better. That is the better of two evils.",196,republican party vote democratic candidate,I have found the prospect of another Bush-Clinton face-off deeply disappointing.  If the race comes down to those two I will do something I have never considered doing; either not vote for any presidential candidate (I will still vote for local candidates up for office) or vote for a third-party candidate.
6,234,win election democratic nomination party,"Whether Bernie Sanders can defeat Hillary or not (and whether he could win a general election or not), his candidacy can help to focus ALL of the Democratic candidates on progressive politics. In short, while the odds are still strong that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination (if not the general election thereafter), if she does get the nomination my prediction is that she will be a stronger and much more relevant candidate in the general election because Bernie made her think about what the Democratic party really is supposed to represent. That, in and of itself, is reason enough for me to support Bernie while he still has a chance.",148,trump bush jeb donald hillary,"I don't support Donald Trump.  He's a nightmare.  And I'm a Democrat.That said, obviously Megyn Kelly went after Trump on a personal level not shown to other candidates. Nobody asked Jeb about stealing the 2000 election.  ""Tough questioning"" is only fair if all are asked tough questions.  Trump was treated unfairly. He's not the GOP establishment which, with the media, is treating him as an illegitimate candidate.  Trump's a lousy candidate ---but he's as legitimate as the others.Even more egregious was the accusation Trump referenced Kelly's menstruation on Don Lemon's show.  I watched it live and he didn't.  It was taken out of context. No surprise the GOP and the media ran with this smear.  But I was sorry Hillary Clinton repeated it.This lie matters if it bothers you when the Clintons are smeared, when candidates John Kerry, John McCain and Max Cleland were swiftboated.  Or the constant lying about Obama (Kenya anyone?).  If you don't object to sandbagging Trump with lies because you despise Trump, what right do you have to object to smears about HRC or Obama?  After all the witch hunts unleashed on the Clintons, I'm amazed HRC threw in on this dirty mess.The truth matters, even the truth about what Donald Trump said.  Lies and smears are always wrong and cheapen our democracy.  If establishment Democrats and HRC aren't above smearing Donald Trump, they're no better than the Bushes, Roger Ailes, or FOX News. Or Donald Trump himself."
7,98,nyt news sources story anonymous,"As a long time NYT subscriber and fan I was seriously disappointed in the NYT when a reporter ended up being at best a willing stooge and operative for the Bush administration run up to war with Iraq over non existing weapons of mass destruction. I am even more disappointed in the NYT over this story as I switched tv channels this morning as another right wing blow hard named Scarborough [Just a thin version of Rush Limbaugh] is trumpeting the NYT's reporting calling for a ""criminal"" investigation of Secretary Clinton. I thought he was going to start calling for her impeachment.This story is the proverbial toothpaste that cannot be put back in the tube or even be cleaned up fairly because of the poor reporting and editorial work and the clear lack of any sense of responsibility to get the story right by NYT until it is so late the damage is irreparably done.  Has the NYT became a weapon of mass destruction of the truth by giving credibility to right wing partisan leaks and propaganda?  First the Iraq war and now the war on Hillary Clinton?I find it hard to consider the NYT the national paper of record anymore and or continuing to pay for a subscription.  ",138,classified server email information state,"While there is no doubt of the Times ongoing bias in their coverage of Secretary Clinton, the Times doubling down and not admitting any wrongdoing on the criminal inquiry story pertaining to her emails is disturbing.The story still doesn't make sense. Multiple press reports state the State Dept has two email systems- a secure email system for classified information and an unsecure email system. Secretary Clinton's personal email account on her server was in lieu of using her unsecure government email account. If anyone sent classified information to her, including summarization of classified information to any unsecure email, a criminal referral would be appropriate as it pertains to the sender, not the recipient, unless the email was marked ""classified"" or the recipient had knowledge that the email included classified information. The Times and other media outlets focus on the server, but how is it relevant? If Clinton uses a private server, classified information was potentially compromised unknown to her. If she used her personal email, but didn't maintain her own server, classified information was maintained on an unsecure server maintained by a vendor. If the classified information was sent to her unsecure government email, how would the result be any different in terms of classified information sent on an unsecure email account?  The Times story failed to address this point at all, and the statements from the State Dept. IG needed further vetting and explanation."
8,94,hilary bernie win like joe,"Bernie is already on the left of Hilary - so, where would Joe be? On the left of Bernie, or somewhere between Bernie and Hilary? Neither would win him more votes than either Bernie or Hilary are going to get. Although he is certainly a likable candidate and would be a great president.",274,people clinton know like want,"From a logistics standpoint, a personal server is a poor choice because it's hard to manage, but other than that, it's inconsequential. I cannot believe people care about this. Is it just ignorance on the part of most people who don't know how email works? Maybe people just really hate Hillary Clinton and will come up with anything they can criticize her. There's no issue. There's nothing to clear up. Let's start talking about the dozens of real issues."
9,244,change mrs people black clinton,"I think this misses several points.  First, Hillary was neither president nor a member of Congress at the time the law passed.  Her husband was. If we are going to fault her for his administration's defects, we need to also credit her for the positives which I know won't happen. Second, her answer was not evasive, it just was not what BLM wanted to hear.  Nor was it the apology you are confusingly seeking. Mrs. Clinton very clearly said that feelings are not as important as action. ""“I don’t believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate.""  Third, you leave out a key factor about BLM. Hillary tries to engage them on what steps she will take on a policy level and what they want from politicians. They reject her engagement claiming that because she is not black, she can't offer any advice.  I understand that Mrs. Clinton is not warm and fuzzy but she has done nothing that requires contrition and did offer more than a dodge.",40,crime violent law laws blow,"Mr. Blow you can't dismiss the fact that violent crime was a driving force in the anti crime law Clinton signed. That would be rewriting history. Nor can you deny the fact that murders have declined by half since that law went into effect. Now that we have a lessening of violent crime and the awful results of the ""war on drugs"" have been exposed we need to change the laws once again. But what Sec. Clinton said was true, that anti-violence legislation was a response to factors that needed addressing in the 1990's"
