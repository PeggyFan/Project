Just because Hillary possesses ovaries doesn't insulate her from poor judgment and a lack of commitment to the leftist values that are important to me.  Symbolism is a terrible reason to vote for someone.  Being worried about the Supreme Court overturning what's left of our civil rights is a more valid reason; why doesn't the Times start asking Hillary about the importance of leftist judges who understand the checks and balances of a federalist system, and focus less on email and obvious gender characteristics?Hillary has female sex organs.  Wow.  Is this a new discovery?  No.  Get over it, move along.  Unless you're writing an expose about the pervasive sexism of the American public.  That's worth 2000 words.  That's not about Hillary, though, and would require thought to make it page-view worthy.How about-- Hillary continues to be inconsistent on the issues, and doesn't answer questions, here are examples, and here is why we are worried-- all without mentioning Bill Clinton or Hillary's gender even once? _That_would be news.

And anyone in my position would do MUCH, MUCH better business-wise if the rich were taxed more and the money was used to support the middle class (like Sanders' idea to tax Wall St to pay higher ed tuition). In this case the middle-income Americans would have more to spend.I'll gladly pay a few thousand more in taxes per year, to make tens of thousands more because the pool of available customers will expand (when the middle class is doing better).Even if you don't have a heart at all or any ethical standards, it is just plain economic sense.

They are the ones who have consistently destroyed their party's chances because a determined wealthy group of right wing zealots would rather attack their candidates throughout the entire primary process to advance their selfish personal interests than focus on winning the White House.  Their candidate ultimately has to grovel to them and their antiquated views on social issues such as same sex marriage, abortion, income inequality and immigration.  The result is a weak candidate who has changed positions so often in order to get nominated that they have little, if any, credibility left with anyone by the end of the convention.Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren will effectively lead, and keep, Hilary to the left on some issues.  But who is going to do that for the Republicans, lead them to the more reasonable center?  No-one.  They are already self-destructing months before the first primary and exposing yet another group of weak candidates eager to do and say anything for money.  They form into a circle and start firing.  It's a losing strategy but the one they are stuck with.Hilary may not be completely in line with some traditional Democratic interests but, compared with the eventual Republican candidate, they'll vote for her anyway.","Bernie Sanders will do well in this campaign with PEOPLE OF ALL AGES because he represents ordinary Americans.

Who, in their right mind, thinks this is okay to give up our representative government over to multinationals ? People who think it's only about trade are dangerously naive and playing into the hands of the multinationals. Even Doctors Without Borders understand that TPP will cause necessary medical drugs to become exorbitantly too expensive for the poor. The big pharmaceutical companies will price gouge and cause generic drugs to be too costly under TPP. The big pharmaceutical's lobbyists helped write TPP...collusion and illegal comes to mind.  All the multinational lawyers and lobbyists have helped write it and were able to read it in depth...but the American people have been kept in the dark. The media has been guilty of not covering TPP in depth, reminds me of the same lousy coverage of the run up to the Iraq war by the media. The media didn't do it's job then and are failing the American people now !  There is no excuse for Obama to push TPP this hard without the American people's representation. The democrats who voted for this are traitors to the American people. Bernie Sanders stood up against TPP, he knows it will totally destroy our middle class and destroy our sovereignty. Wiithout a middle class our country will have NO DEMOCRACY and other functioning democracies have a middle class.

Popular will has given way to the will of billionaires. FDR defined this as fascism. The question in 2016 is whether our freedom can survive a GOP victory.Except to the extent that some are worse than the others it makes no difference who the GOP runs. Not one is qualified for office by experience  or has a vision of the future they dare disclose.  Not so with the Democrats My choice would be Sanders but his chance of election is risky and while the people like him and his program, there is a risk we cannot take that a Republican will get elected on a tidalwave of money and slander.The much slandered and highly qualified Hillary though actually to the left of Obama is the safest bet against having a billionaire controlled pigmy in the White House.  Bill Clinton who, as Republican-lite, cared about people and was extremely well liked, ran the country well, although he signed some awful Republican laws. The Republicans have changed the rules of the game and now complain that Hillary is not only playing by their rules that she is good at it. I want Warren or Sanders but Warren wonâ€™t run and Sanders will not play the game an will loose.
