Despite their negativity and do nothing idea, he persevered and has tried his best to fix some of the problems their party have created ever since Ronald Reagan (their B actor president).

641,"As an Econ teacher its the only book of his that I make reference to. Trump is not a free mkt supporter but then again the US is mixed not free market economy. Our gov plays a role in econ decision making. An important principle of eco is that people respond to incentives. Incentives are determined by institutions the most powerful being gov. Successful entrepreneurs recognize this relationship between institutions and incentives. In the book the Art of The Deal, Trump details how incentives were used in his early deals including  his hotel on 42nd . He did same with  Trump Tower, The  Skating Ring in Central park Etc. Trump understands the importance of both institutions and incentives. That said, more importantly Trump fails to demonstrate any understanding of  important economic principles such as  trade and immigration. Greater freedom/choice to shop for example in a mall rather than in a single store results in greater satisfaction. Trade permits greater economic freedom which means specialization,  efficiency, growth, a higher standard of living, and SATISFACTION. Therefore a vote for Trump will be economically unsatisfactory. Looking at production poss, Deporting millions of people who both produce and consume will reduce our nation's overall production poss. Making the illegals citizens,  can vote or drive are political issues. The economics of this situation are clear.

Third, he had the courage to take risks.  Fourth, Trump put business and the pursuit and acquisition of results above ideology, which is probably where our friend Josh has the real problem by saying Trump is not one of us.

The higher standard for a candidate is what can you accomplish?  Trump meets this higher standard.  He is not humble about it, perhaps that rankles old-fashioned conservatives who are looking for the perfect pied-piper.  The problem is that the perfect pied-piper ends up being nothing more than a paid spokesperson for the lobbyists and special interests.  We don't want that.

Narcissists are people who lack empathy, who are not accountable for their behavior. They set up their world so it’s about themselves. They exploit others for their own gain. If you’re in a relationship with a narcissist, you eventually discover you are there to revolve around them and to serve them.

Hillary has not brought anything new to the table. So in this  stagnant vacuum of mass cynicism, we now have Bernie Sanders on the left and Trump on the right.

Agree with everyone who says we want our police to be the best they can be etc.  But the BLM movement was founded on a false narrative and unfairly targets police AND paints Blacks as victims of White society.<br/><br/>Now for the stat -- the murder rate for the USA, the likelihood of being murdered, is under 5 per 100,000 population.  But for Black males ages 17-34, the risk is roughly 55 per 100,000.  I'd walk you through the math but I don't have enough space here (sort of like Fermat's last theorem).  Well, ok here it is --  Black males in that age group are roughly 6 million individuals.  Annually, about 3400 are murdered.  You can do the rest.<br/><br/>Most of the murderers are Black.  If a cop never killed another Black in that age group, it would barely make a dent in the murder rate -- and if you back out justified killings -- no impact at all.<br/><br/>So, the outrage, the victimhood, etc. directed at cops and White America for the murders of young Black males is misplaced.

There has never been a point in American history when our economy was not dependent on the contributions of immigrants. This has been true from slavery, to the Eastern European industrial influx, to the new wave of ""third world"" immigrats began landing our shores in the 1960s and 1970s, bringing with them a wave of advancements in countless fields, most notably American science and technology.<br/>Furthermore, immigration is what has shielded us from fates of other developed nations, including aging population and economic stagnation. At a higher level, scholars and politicians should factor these considerations into any decision on immigration policy, but these points may be overlooked by the (understandably) immediate concerns of everyday Americans. In short, by speaking directly to the shortsighted or xenophobic concerns of certain radical (and perhaps misinformed) American citizens, conveniently disregarding logos in favor of pathos appeal, Trump neglects that the tradition of immigration in America is what has provided a counterbalance to domestic stagnancy and complacency, ills which affect far too many of our peer developed and post-democratic societies.",,0,NYC,False,72865890,1441296775

First is that The Chicken Hawks that make up such a large percentage of the GOP are, on some deep level, aware that their belligerence is equaled only by their reluctance to serve.  It's why they went after Kerry in such a big way about his service; and why they don't respect McCain for his.   McCain is just a tortured reminder of past military failure.  And he doesn't even want to water board the 'Perfidious Muslims"". Second are those who did serve, and have always regarded the Senator as ""The Admiral's Boy"" an incompetent screw-up who caused the loss of several perfectly good aircraft (and probably the USS Forrestal fire). Third, are the ones who just don't care, because Mr. Trump so clearly enunciates their gut obsessions on the subject of ""Dark People Who Are Ruining Our Country"".

If Donald Trump could not control his emotions during a testimony, how could he control his emotions during a crisis as a president?  Also, during the same testimony, Donald Trump called the lawyer, Elizabeth Beck, that her questions were “very stupid”. Not only is this rude, but it shows that he wouldn’t want to take questions from ordinary citizens. A good president would listen to everyone’s issues and try to find the best way to solve them. When Elizabeth Beck asked for a medical break, Mr. Trump denied her request, and demanded that the testimony continue. Even when Elizabeth Beck explained that is was an emergency and that she needed to pump breast milk for her 3-month-old, Trump and his lawyers still didn’t let her take the break. To prove her point, Mrs. Beck took out her pump. In response, Donald Trump Said “You’re disgusting”. This shows that he is rude and apathetic to other people’s needs.

Building railroads or shoveling the absolutely jaw dropping amount of horse droppings that accumulated in New York City at the time was not the typical citizen's idea of a great career. Most of the animosity directed toward the Irish centered around their ability to shift political control in a rent seeking era. The US doesn't currently have full employment hence modern immigrants face protectionism more than strict xenophobia despite the rhetoric.<br/><br/>Finally, the Irish had one singular advantage over most modern immigrants.

The real place where the laws need to be enforced is when employers employ illegal immigrants as low wage workers, knowingly or in ways that allow them to use plausible deniability as a cover. If we can hike up enforcement of deportations as vigorously as President Obama has done, and if we can check on the emails of John Doe to see if he is consorting with the bad guys, I am sure we can check if employers are breaking the law. As always, business gets a get out of jail card, and we pay for it. In this case, decades of looking the other way have decimated the market for low-skills but nevertheless essential jobs. I think a strong case can be made that If employers had no choice but to hire legal workers for farm or construction work, we would not have the spectacle of people working full time and yet being horribly indigent. Yes, our burgers and our lettuce would cost more, but that would only be fair, and we would find a new, better, more just equilibrium in our distribution of wealth, we would not have the grotesque inequality we do now, and our society would be hugely better off.<br/><br/>Prosecute the real illegals, Mr. Obama --- the employers, not the employees.",,22,Wilmette,False,47285937,1436572479

3229,"In days bygone, one did not do what he thought was wrong. As a judicial system developed, he did not do what was not legal, though he thought it was wrong. Then lawyers told him, you could do anything as long as you could safeguard yourself legally and helped him to do just that. When the long arms of law caught up with him, he was told he was not guilty as long as he was not convicted. When he was convicted lawyers told him a conviction in a lower court did not matter. He would be guilty only when his appeal is decided against him by the highest court. When the time came for that, it was suggested he make a plea bargain and get his punishment reduced drastically or better still offer 'No Contest', pay a fine and tell the world he was not guilty because he had not admitted to any violation of any law and paid the penalty only to save time and energy. If someone still called him a criminal, he sued that person for defamation! The best way to get out of this is to change the law from 'innocent till proved guilty' to 'guilty until proved innocent' and asking the criminal to prove his innocence. Some other methods could be (1) At least deprive him of all liberties and put him in a cooler while investigations were on so that he would be encouraged to come forth with his own defense faster instead of prolonging the case as long as possible while roaming scotfree to indulge in his nefarious activities. (2) In cases where it is proved that the crime was intentionally committed, the punishment should be disproportionate enough to discourage people from committing the crime. Presently the punishment in most cases is a simple fine. The law specifies what should be the minimum and maximum for each crime, as though if you are willing to pay the fine, you are free to commit that crime. (3) I am told that in Saudi Arabia if you accidentally left your hand bag in a public place, you would find it lying in the same place till you went back to pick it up, because if anyone was caught with anything which did not belong to him, was accused as a thief and the punishment is cutting off his hand! Greed makes one commit a crime and only fear of punishment will overcome greed and stop him from crime.<br/>

At face value, is not what we know about politics, celebrities, and the companies we admire, really more about what they want us to know.  I did my research, asked the right questions and was flat out lied to.  I was told by the developers sales team that Trump was personally and financially vested in the project, that he was a partner, he would own a Penthouse unit himself, I received letters signed by Mr. Trump with his New York office as the return.  The issue for me was not if his actions and involvements were within his trademark and licensing agreements or not, I would assume Mr. Trump did not become who he is by not being savvy.  The problem here is that we the public, we the investors were not privy to his licensing agreements or any such disclosures that indicated this was not his project.  The bottom line here is that he held out to the public as a developer on this project-period. From my point of view, there was great effort in place by the Trump brand, the developer, the real-estate broker, and the sales agents to lead us to believe one thing and in reality was another story.  What was once my opinion of Mr. Trump and those associated with him was all based on the P.R. that was put in front of us by him and perhaps not reality.

Why people might wish to cling to the chaos and drama of anger, fear, and big reactions may have to do with how we are often more comfortable with patterns we know, even if those patterns upset us, than we are with changing our worldview, even if that would bring us greater peace of mind.  Those earlier patterns served some purpose, but at least now, the damage they produce outweighs whatever helpfulness they had.

A very large percentage of the attacks on the sitting president of the United States have to do with racism rather than policy. Most Americans want most of the federal policies that the country has gradually and painfully developed since FDR took office. However, their image of America as being a white country with minorities can't stand the reality of a nation that is approximately 50% not-white. <br/><br/>However, the issue is actually deeper - and worse - than this one single issue. American conservatives have consistently attacked the very foundations of American success. For two centuries this nation has struggled to create the best educated populace on the planet, but since President Reagan, we have allowed our institutions to gradually crumble, to the point that nearly two dozen other countries provide a better education to their populations than does this country; additionally, we have abandoned any semblance of belief in the ethos of democracy and individual freedom, replacing that with an enormous military. Do you know how many military bases the United States maintains in foreign nations? No, you don't, because that is a military secret.<br/><br/>The United States entered WWII with the 17th ranked army in the world: today, this country spends as much on its military as the rest of the world combined. Our school are crumbling, teachers are either fleeing education or they're getting fired; our transportation infrastructure is virtually third world, our medical service is not even available to about 16% of the populace, including millions of children.<br/><br/>These conservatives are simultaneously attacking the power of the federal government to regulate the already corrupt financial institutions that brought about a near-collapse of the entire world economy; they are attempting to gut the federal government's ability to regulate or control the environment and the workplace; they are trying to dismantle unions, and are claiming that federal employees are overpaid.

And what are the odds that either of those examples will be willing or able to work on the hard problems of inequality, reduced social mobility, renewing the social contract, etc.? <br/><br/>Some ideas: ""I propose we set some standards and limits on how the public airwaves — these are licensed from us, the taxpaying public, not owned — are used in political speech.<br/><br/>• All qualified candidates are granted a block of public airtime in the same time slots they buy it now. No shunting them off into the graveyard overnight hours where PSAs languish.<br/>
• Each spot will have a minimum length: no 15 second attacks or cheap shots. If you can’t fill 30-60 seconds, you got no game — go home. There would be no maximum time: if a candidate wants to put up long-form pieces, that’s up to them.<br/>
• The grants will not be so generous as to allow a candidate to campaign solely over the airwaves: personal appearances and debates will have to make up part of the campaign’s messaging strategy.<br/>
• No other organization, party, or individual will be permitted to buy airtime in support of a candidate.<br/><br/>An additional benefit to this is that it helps defeat the benefits of incumbency.

3607,"You know what the real joke is? People seriously deliberating over who potential presidential candidates will or should be more than a year before the election. The election process for presidential candidates in this country is more comparable to entertainment television than people looking at real issues that are relevant to how successful our country will be ten years down the road from a financial, military, and moral standpoint. Today presidential candidates fight through a media that is fueled more by yellow journalism and trash talk. It isn't even real politics any more, what happened to the presidential candidates who weren't simply elected based on which side of the party line happened to have the largest support in a given year?<br/><br/> Since the election of George Bush senior this country has been swinging back and forth between which side of the aisle is running the country. Why? The clear and obvious reason is that neither side of the aisle is giving the American people what WE want. They would rather focus on petty partisan, name calling politics to keep the general American populace (us) in a no-compromise mindset, and we all know that COMPROMISE is probably the most defining word of our constitution. One only has to turn on msnbc to see how much the left hates the right, then change the channel to FOX to see how much the right hates the left. <br/><br/>OPEN YOUR EYES AMERICA, THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM IS BROKEN. The Republicans and Democrats have become so entrenched in Washington, and overall American culture that they have no competition to keep them committed to serving the interests of the people of this once great nation. One of the parties or both needs to die off soon, or the emergence of a real third party which can mediate the two. Right now all the Republicans or Democrats care about is using the media as a tool to keep us divided so they can keep the gravy train rolling! Ever seen the movie Wall Street? The big players like Pelosi, Reid, McCain, Gingrich are all Gordon Gekko's of Washington D.C. that know how to manipulate the system so they keep getting elected, get bigger paychecks, and perpetuate the system that put them on top. Part of that is who they get to fund their campaign, the other part is they know how to earmark, pork-barrel, and haul in money for their state in any way they can, so that their constituency is always pleased.<br/><br/>Its really disgusting to me how people don't see this going on, I encourage people to not vote for mainstream political candidates, they're not interested in helping fix the deficiet, they're not interested in fixing anything thats going to help the joe schmoes. They're interested in pulling the right strings by bringing about issues they know get people riled up so they can keep us divided, the general American populace is being played for a bunch of saps. We don't need them, they need us, and our votes, DON'T GIVE THEM TO THEM. <br/><br/>I believe in competition in all things, it keeps things balanced and prevents monopolies, in the animal kingdom, competion between animal species ensures a balance that prevents the whole system from collapsing. Our capitalistic economy is supposedly in theory no different, the competition prevents a takeover by any one large company, unfortunately that too is starting to not work because we won't let companies fail when they should and allow companies to engage in huge mergers which eliminate competition and therefore efficiency. Our political system should be no different, but right now the two parties have a monopoly bigger than any company ever has, they scratch each others backs while they pretend to hate each other, and want us to hate each other so they cancontinue with the back scratching. We need a political revolution or a great leader to step up change our direction, Obama is not that leader, if you think he's any different from the rest of them think again. He was a nobody and he got elected!! How and why? You don't think the parties plan things like this? If you think Obama being the last man standing in the primaries was an accident you really are a fool. The best politicians (the ones who get elected) know how to strategize and form alliances that play to their advantage. The true problem is that the two party system only allows the most tenacious and vicious to get to the head of the pack.

3614,"Outsourcing Citizenship<br/>
In the war against the middle-class the government has been outsourcing jobs for decades. Now the government is going one step further. They are outsourcing citizenship to bring corporate citizens into their constituency, and give them the rights that go with it. This country started with an agreement between citizens and leaders. Over time we have evolved into shareholders (all shareholders are not equal) and owners. Our Constitutional rights as citizens have been stripped away while the Constitutional rights of corporations have grown. Today, a corporation has the same value as a natural citizen and made the law-of-the-land by the Supreme Court. This corporate citizen acts like a natural citizen. It looks to the government for the conditions to be productive so it can continue to grow.<br/><br/>Corporate citizens have become a weapon in the war against the middle-class. They can be used to take away the power of the vote form the middle-class. Corporate citizens can get congressman to listen to them and ignore the voice of the voter. This is why all polls in America show the government completely out of step with the majority of its natural citizens in every sector in society. On healthcare, education, taxes, war, environment and a host of others the people and the government are not on the same page. It’s not the government following the will of the people. Instead, it’s the government doing the bidding of its corporate citizens by writing legislation to legalize the assault on unions and teachers.<br/><br/>But, the needs of a citizen and the needs of a corporation are not the same. Natural citizens need and want opportunity and means to be successful and happy. They want government to provide a level playing field for all. Corporate citizens want and need control of the market to maximize profits. The natural citizen wants to live the American Dream and retire while the corporate citizen will be struggle to grow into an empire- builder. Natural citizens used to say their thanks with a handshake. The corporate citizen says thanks with a cash contribution. <br/><br/>The only weapon of the natural citizen is being taken away. He’s being disarmed. But, it’s not his guns he’s losing. What is being taken away is his VOTE. Given to those with citizenship, by the Constitution. The vote – the most effective weapon of the citizen to force the government to listen to him, is being given to corporations. Today their votes are meaningless. They have been made meaningless by a political system driven by money. Who can own the most government? A citizen’s vote has no political value to a congressman, he can’t put it in his war chest. In the battle between the natural citizens and the corporate citizens you only have to look at D.C. and see who represents who. There are thousands and thousands of these corporate citizens. The lobbyists and the think tanks and the media are grafting themselves onto the three branches of the government. It’s Ike’s worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Presidents throughout my lifetime have initiated foreign wars without the approval of the Congress. So why doesn’t Congress take back its power? Since all wars are now political the Congress would rather the White House start the war. The Congress will manage them. With war so profitable for corporate citizens why would they ever want to limit such a money making product? They wouldn’t. That’s why war is no longer a few pages every couple of hundred pages in history books. War is a part of our daily lives.<br/>
The government doesn’t have to be afraid. Votes don’t matter anymore.<br/>

Although in the post-civil rights era the GOP could seldom use outright racist lanuage to lure the gullible, uninformed, and prejudiced Bubbas into the once-hated Republican party, it found a host of code words to let the aging white southerners know the party was out to deligitimize black achievement.  That effort has spiked now that we have our first black president.  First they attacked him as an alien immigrant with a forged birth certificate. When that was disproved, they switched to claiming he was an intellectual fraud, unworthy of Columbia and Harvard.  What will it be tomorrow?

4410,"It's curious to me the turn that these Correspondents' dinners have taken in the last couple years since Obama became president.  Yes, they were prone to stir up controversy in the past, such as when Bush showed a video of himself searching around the White House for those missing weapons of mass destruction or when Stephen Colbert delivered a pitch perfect satire of Bush policy and excoriated the Washington press corps for not doing more to challenge and cut through the Bush facade.  (News coverage of Bush took a noticeably critical turn after that night, I should add.)  Generally, though, the night has always been one in which the president took a chance to laugh at himself and at his own administration.  Any jabs at political foes, if made at all, were delivered with velvet gloves.  The point of the night was for the president to show some humility and humor, giving him a more personable and lighthearted opportunity to interact with the press.  The size of the event has grown beyond this in some ways, but presidents generally treated the night as this kind of opportunity.<br/><br/>Not so for Obama.  In successive dinners, Obama has taken the chance to launch mean-spirited zingers at his foes and to publicly cut them down.  He hardly ever turns the comic lens on himself and instead just keeps hitting others in jokes that are more attuned to the insult-driven style of Frankie Boyle than anything else.  There is no self-reflection, no humility, no laughing at one's own foibles.  All I hear are narcissistic lashings leveled at other people.  That kind of humor is sometimes funny in the right context, from someone like Frankie Boyle when people are going to hear him with the expectation that he is going to make nasty jokes about them and other helpless people.  Coming from the president, it's not so much funny as just plain mean.<br/><br/>All hail to the Bully in Chief.  There's not much difference in how Obama handles himself in a speech on the budget, to which he invites his chief foe, Paul Ryan, and then launches into him with an insulting salvo, which Ryan has to sit through with no means to respond, and how he carries himself on a night of comedy, at which he levels the boom on Donald Trump, who, although he might have it coming given his various statements recently, sits in a similarly weak, vulnerable position, unable to reply.

Mr. Trump and the birthers were presumably aware of this from the outset. In the absence of assertion of conspiracy by the State of Hawaii, case closed. Reasonable, honest men would have moved on;<br/><br/>Secondly; If the birthplace of a candidate for the presidency had been a valid concern of Mr. Trump and the birthers, they would have challenged the candidacy of Senator McCain, but nothing was said. The Senator, one of the most committed and rightly admired men in U.S. politics in the last 30 years, was born in 1936 in the Panama Canal Zone. Although administered by the U.S. from 1903 to 1999, the Zone, including the canal itself, remained at all times Panamanian territory. If this was to be an issue at all as between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, who would have had the stronger claim to U.S. birth?<br/><br/>Mr. Trump and the birthers have been deliberate and disingenuous in this campaign. The certification from the State of Hawaii is uncontroverted. However,Mr. Trump prevaricates, and deals with the evidence by suggestion, inference and innuendo designed to feed the prejudices of the birthers. Unfortunately, as your article and others confirm, polls show that as much as 25% of the adult population harbour some doubt about the location of the President's birth. Pandering to the ignorant and the unlettered in this way is corrosive of the public trust which must necessarily exist in the office of the President, and is intellectually dishonest.<br/><br/>There is nothing trivial or silly in this personal attack on the President and the media, including the New York Times, should spearhead a campaign to educate the people in this matter. At a time when, as a result of the sorry state of public schools, many American school-children and, unfortunately, many of their parents, cannot identify or locate Hawaii on a map, the media have a responsibility.

No, the President should not concede to hysteria, unreasonable, absurb demands to show anything to prove what is already constitutionally true: children born to American citizens, under the 14th amendment and US Code 9, are American citizens. This is an attempt to blame the victim, but more importantly as the Charles Blow column pointed out it is one of a long series of attempts--Muslim, socialist, to delegitimize the authority of the person and the office. Notice that no other President has suggested the simple solution? The reason: no President, on any issue, small, large, or controversial, should cave to being bullied or pushed by detractors to kowtow to those who want to pull his or her strings to take away ther humanity or legitmacy. Moreover, one demand would follow another. And then another.

He has for the last few decades and he'll be back in 2016 and 2020 and so on as long as he's still drawing enough breath to utter his over-the-top, self-congratulatory blustering.",,0,TX,False,61449375,1305757803
4790,"The danger was not that Trump would run for the GOP nomination and either succeed or fail to face Obama in the general as the opposite number but that he might try and fail and become convinced to try running as a third party independent based upon warm words of welcoming affection during the primary campaign. As such a 3rd party, Trump's effect on the general election would have added an unpredictable variable on an otherwise complex polynomial - would he take more votes from Obama or Romney, for example?<br/><br/>The fcat that he won't be running at all is the important fact. Receiving none of the aforementioned welcoming warm wishes into what was, prior to his involvement, a very tepid field of pseudo-challengers. He revealed something - that GOP voters are disatisfied with they choices they have now and are likely to have next year as well. They are begging for a better choice. The fact is that there are none right now. This is what the GOP has to offer - Romney or Pawlenty. Too bad.<br/><br/>The reason why this week was good news for Obama was that this checks off two more of those items on the list of 13 Keys to the Presidency: Obama will not have a charismatic/national hero opponent and he will not have a serious 3rd party independent candidate. Which brings his total to 9 items checked off on the list. Everyone elected to the White House since 1860 has had to check off at least 8 of these items. It is possible, however, that as a racial minority he may need to check off more of them than an average candidate - in 2008 he had 10 check marks going for him. But there are 3 more possibles and 2 of them are economic. So we may not know for a year if he is a safe bet for re-election, but having Romney as his only remaining opponent standing is a big help.<br/>

Now if only Romney were to have a Schwartzennegar-like bimbo eruption at some point this summer and decide not to run, we'd be sitting pretty with a bunch of has-beens (Gingrich) never wases (Pawlenty) and no-hopers (Paul/Cain) left as possible challengers.

The success of the Sanders insurgency campaign promises good Democratic primary debates that will attract viewership and put the focus on substantive issues, not a Reality-TV candidate insinuating his opponents are gay and having spats with Faux-News personalities.

But savaging Hillary, which is the point of the article, and a disproportional focus, is also an exercise in unreason.  Her failure, if it is to be, will be her own, not that of her party.  Trump, on the other hand, is a threat not only to his own party but to the nature of civil discourse upon which we have all relied.  Hillary may be unappealing but as a woman it should be pointed out, she is hampered by bias toward her gender: if she is adamant she is shrill where a man is forceful; if she's informal she's silly where a man is down-to-earth; if she's smart she's cold where a man has substance.  As for honesty, it is not a quality we value so much in politicians as is the appearance of honesty [otherwise we wouldn't even be talking about Trump].  It is Hillary's fumbling that is seen as unworthy, not the mistake itself. A woman has to be tough to play a man's game, and when she manages that feat, she is suddenly seen as humorless, cold, and stiff.

In any other instance of contemporary media, we refer to these personalities as trolls. Mr. Wehner, like several other of his colleagues, is simply that.

Nor was the news that Clinton used private email a ""stunning revelation"" to the millions of Americans, myself included, who although they may not have a private server, use private e-mail addresses to exchange non-confidential information with their colleagues.  <br/><br/>Clinton's records as Secretary of State is also misstated by Wehner, and although there's not sufficient space here to refute him point by point, most of his allegations-- our alleged declining reputation in the world, e.g. -- are arguable at best, and at worst, empty rhetoric.  E.g., our international reputation was mud when GW Bush left office; Obama, Clinton and Kerry, many would argue, have done much to restore it.<br/><br/>Further, not a single so-called scandal or which Clinton has been investigated was substantiated.  Yet, playing on Bill Clinton's alleged reputation for sleaze - i.e., stereotypes of poor Southern whites - the Republicans continue to throw mud, hoping something will stick. <br/><br/>The only accurate criticism by Wehner is that HRC is not a natural pol.

For the reasons stated by  Mr. Wehner with respect to Mrs. Clinton's actions re over-hauling US medical policy, her weak performance as a Senator, and the disastrous way she handled her 2008 campaign, I supported Obama in 2008.  I do not fault her for the weak performance as Secy of State since such position is basically to carry out the policies of the President.  However, because of  her carelessness re the server situation and the sleaziness of her responses regardless of whether such actions were only misdeameanors or nearly so, if Mrs. Clinton cared more about the country than she does about being president, she should pull out of the campaign.  I believe her staying in hampers others from declaring themselves as candidates, particularly as Vice President Biden.  Personally, I think he still has the fire in his belly to be President and give it all he's got but given the death of his son, I would think he has no heart to fight dirty with Mrs. Clinton which is something she would induce and encourage..

But candidates are judged and finally elected on how they handle crises.  While I'm a progressive Democrat who is not a big fan of Secretary Clinton, if she survives the email kerfuffle, she will emerge as a very formidable candidate.  And, that is truly what the Republicans and Mr. Wehner fear most as Donald No-Trump takes them off the ultra-right political cliff into the abyss of xenophobic racism and misogyny (with absolutely no push-back by his competitors) where they believe only the ultra-left Bernie Sanders might save them from oblivion.
