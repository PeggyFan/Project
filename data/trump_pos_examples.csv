1,"""Crude, erratic, unprincipled and unelectable, Mr. Trump, if he were to win the nomination, would do catastrophic damage to the Republican Party.""Convenient thinking, Mr. Wehner. Donald Trump, or at least his popularity among Republican voters, is a product of decades of Republican policy, and the particular perspectives of constituents which the Republican party has cultivated.Trump did not create Republican voters. He's simply appealing to the voters Republicans gave voice to."
2,"Mr. Bruni obviously has a low opinion of Mr. Trump as evidenced by all the bad-mouthing he  managed to scrape up and toss at him.  Bit I think Mr. Bruni misses the reason Mr. Trump is doing so well in the polls and that is: Mr. Trump speaks forthrightly about political matters and in doing so becomes a standout among all the establishment mumblers who are trying to catch the candidate ring as the political merry-go-round twirls around.  Mr. Trump even had the forthrightness to put a pin in Mr. McCain's balloon.  Call him what you will, Mr. Bruni, but Mr. Trump has captured not just Christians but a great many ordinary voters across the country. "
3,"No mention of Bernie Sanders again. I am getting tired of the corporate media's fascination with Donald ""Il Duce"" Trump. Where is the coverage of Bernie Sanders's campaign? Even Joe Biden is getting more coverage than Bernie Sanders, and he isn't even running for office.Why does the NY Times spend gallons of ink on Donald Trump's offensive behavior and virtually none on Bernie Sanders's measured discussion of important policy proposals?"
4,"One rumor among many about Trump is that he is determined to stop Jeb Bush from winning the GOP nomination. Who can blame Trump for wanting to do that? That the younger brother of George W. Bush is a serious candidate for the GOP nomination in 2016 is unbelievable and arguably the main reason for the attraction of Trump's campaign. I mean, did the GOP turn to one of Richard Nixon's younger brothers in 1980 for the presidential nomination? No, because that would have looked every bit as stupid as Republicans turning to George W. Bush's younger brother in 2016 for the presidential nomination. Trump appears to understand how totally ridiculous Jeb Bush's presence in this campaign looks to ordinary people, and Trump knows that his own campaign for president looks no more ridiculous than Bush's and may actually have stronger merits. Because you see, the presidential campaign of virtually ANY human being on planet earth would contain stronger merits than one being waged by the younger brother of George W. Bush. Even if Jeb hadn't been pulling strings for his brother's campaign in Florida 15 years ago, that would still be true. "
5,"One thing is illegal immigration and a different thing is illegal immigrants. Illegal immigration is a cancer a should be stopped. Illegal immigrants are people who, at least most of them, are hard workers that came in search of a better and safer life. They are not only Mexican but from all over the world.Mr Trump has a good point, but no tact."
6,"To me the interesting thing is not Trump himself but the outsized fear he seems to generate in people like Rattner.People that like Trump, like him because they have figured out at this point that our so called leaders don't lead and are basically corrupt mouthpieces for big money interests in this country. That hold true for both parties.The people don't really like Trump, they just hate him less than the traditional politicians."
7,"Hey there, GOP! Go right ahead and take Trump on; see what happens. I would never vote for Trump, but the hand-wringing and fear that he has put into the GOP establishment amount to some of the best moments of political schadenfreude that I have ever enjoyed. The GOP made Mr. Trump; if they try to bring him down, the entire GOP balloon will collapse in on itself. "
8,I love Donald Trump! He's quite the best thing going in all politics. It's nice knowing that the Times will never publish some lapdog piece about Donald Trump like David Remnick's article about Obama. With Donald Trump it's fresh air all around.
9,"Let me be clear:  In my view, in their roles as debate moderators, Megyn Kelly and her male colleagues were consummate professionals. Did I think the questions were designed to mess with Donald Trump's head? Yes, I did. My guess is those questions were approved and may have even been written by Roger Ailes.So, when Trump said that stuff implying that Kelly was having her period, did he believe that? Of course not.  I believe he was trying to mess with her head and Fox News in general.So, it is ironic that watching the news channels today and reading main stream media on the Internet as well as some sites like Redstate.com, Donald Trump and references to his trashy comment to Kelly is omnipresent. Of course, I don't know what Trump's authentic reaction was or is to this coverage (Does anyone ever know Trump's authentic reaction to anything?), but I imagine that ""unhappy"" he is not.Moving past this phony scandal, did Fox News skew the questions to pander to Republicans? Of course, they did! No one expected anything else.Donald Trump v. Megyn Kelly (emissary of Roger Ailes, Republican gray eminence) "
