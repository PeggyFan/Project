0,Joe Biden should run.  All this smothering sympathy seems like right out a recent cocktail party.  Joe Biden would enliven the campaign for the Democratic nomination.  When President Obama seemed to be screwing up his campaign in 2012 it was Joe Biden's fighting campaign style that helped the president win in crucial states.  Just leaving the nomination to Hilary Clinton could be very dangerous.  With the Clinton's seemingly endless ability to find themselves in avoidable controversy it makes sense for the Democrats to open up the field.
1,"While there is no doubt of the Times ongoing bias in their coverage of Secretary Clinton, the Times doubling down and not admitting any wrongdoing on the criminal inquiry story pertaining to her emails is disturbing.The story still doesn't make sense. Multiple press reports state the State Dept has two email systems- a secure email system for classified information and an unsecure email system. Secretary Clinton's personal email account on her server was in lieu of using her unsecure government email account. If anyone sent classified information to her, including summarization of classified information to any unsecure email, a criminal referral would be appropriate as it pertains to the sender, not the recipient, unless the email was marked ""classified"" or the recipient had knowledge that the email included classified information. The Times and other media outlets focus on the server, but how is it relevant? If Clinton uses a private server, classified information was potentially compromised unknown to her. If she used her personal email, but didn't maintain her own server, classified information was maintained on an unsecure server maintained by a vendor. If the classified information was sent to her unsecure government email, how would the result be any different in terms of classified information sent on an unsecure email account?  The Times story failed to address this point at all, and the statements from the State Dept. IG needed further vetting and explanation."
2,"No more Bushes, no more Clintons. "
3,"Until Charles M. Blow and the ""Black Lives Matter"" activists angrily confront Barack Obama in front of the cameras for what he's failed to do for the Black community the same way BLM is attacking Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton for what they HAVE done to help the Black Community, this movement does not ""matter"" to this Black man. "
4,"Message to Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton from ""conservatives"":  Sorry, Ms. Rodham Clinton.  We all know you are the SMARTEST AND MOST QUALIFIED PERSON to be elected the next President of the United States.  But, you know, you're just a mere woman.  Can't trust women you know - ever since Eve in the garden of eden.  We're doing everything we can to make you seem dishonest and turn women against you so they don't vote for you and make you the first female President of the United States of America.  Just look at all the fine unqualified men, and token woman, we have running against you.  We even have the loudest mouth in America running to try to stop you.  We're just crossing our fingers that voters don't use their heads and elect you.   "
5,"Mr. Wehner's ostensible argument was that both the Republican and Democratic parties were in a race of self-destruction.His evidence? The political campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.I can understand how Mr.Trump's campaign may be a manifestation of Republican self-destruction. But I would not assign blame to Mr. Trump for that destruction. At best, or at worst, Mr. Trump can be accused of, or complimented for, taking advantage of that self-destruction.I don't see how Hillary Clinton's campaign is leading to the self-destruction of the Democratic party. First, what evidence do we have that the Democratic party is indeed self-destructing? Trump's campaign seems to indicate that Republican elites have lost control over their base. Can we say the same of Clinton's campaign as a sign of loss of control of Democratic elites over their base? Despite ranting in the media (as in the immediate case), there does not seem to be a breakdown between the Democratic elite, Clinton's campaign, and most Democratic voters. And I say that as someone who is a political Independent (no party affiliation) who is leaning heavily toward Bernie Sanders. So I'm not someone who will be unhappy if Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. But I will also not be distraught in Clinton becomes President, as polls still show her beating Trump, and the rest of the Republican field.Other than in fevered dreams such as Wehner's, there's no basis for equating the Trump and Clinton campaigns."
6,"BLM activists will achieve nothing by blaming things on the Clintons.  In addition, by the strict PC policing of the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" as opposed to any other wording, and the narcissistic performance art of the Sanders' protesters, any message they hope to impart is being lost.  The movement appears to be a rant and rage and blame machine.  You may not like what the Clintons did in the past but what does it matter in making policy today?  You'll be waiting a long time for an apology, and if you get it, what good will it do policy-wise?  Do you want an apology or policy change?Hillary was right with her interaction with the BLM protestors.  If they choose to waste their time and effort in getting an apology, they're going to lose their opportunity to effect any real change and just turn everybody off in the interim."
7,"Spare me.  The New York Times too tough on Hillary Clinton?  Times coverage gives only a fraction of the picture of the Clinton misdeeds and scandals.  A small fraction.As to the objectors whom the Public Editor cites in taking up the cudgels, I can’t speak to Jay Rosen.  But Rachel Maddow, of Al Sharpton’s MSNBC?  Who is even farther left than Ed Koch’s classic phrase “to the left of Chairman Mao.”  James Fallows, once President Carter’s chief White House speechwriter, a long time writer for the Atlantic which consistently champions President Obama and attacks conservatives. The facts in “Clinton Cash” can’t be disputed so include the Times in the shooting of the messenger because it had an agreement with the author.Years ago we saw one Clinton scandal after another, of Bill, of Hillary, of both. Nothing has changed, including the lies and the cover-ups. The Times indeed deserves credit for not leaving the Hillary Clinton malfeasance to the conservative media.   The Public Editor duly took the Times to the wood shed on the IG inquiry story.  This column is a sequel shot across the bow--the Times should watch itself so as not to roil the left or the Public Editor will be back on the case.  Which hardly serves the interests of standards of journalism excellence. Eventually, of course, news coverage aside, the Times will endorse Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primaries and in the presidential election when inevitably she becomes the Democratic nominee.     "
8,"This is ridiculous. I nearly didn't read this story because the headline doesn't tell the truth. Instead of ""A Clinton Story Fraught with Inaccuracies"" which made me think that Clinton was telling inaccurate stories, why don't you say ""We Got It Wrong: Why We Published an Inaccurate and Damaging Story about Hillary Clinton."" Also the original story was front page news and was beeped to my phone as ""Breaking News"" and I think this should be too. Otherwise occasional readers like myself (or anyone who doesn't scour the NYT site) and just reads haphazardly on their phone is still think Clinton has criminal charges against her. I used to trust the NYT, now I realize I cannot. "
9,"Dismissing Bernie Sanders as a socialist, as the main stream media and the Hillary Clinton supporters have already done, or as a crazy is a mistake.  Bernie Sanders's ideas not only make sense to the majority of the American people but he is also the toughest politician which I've seen since LBJ.I changed my voter registration from Independent to Democrat in order to be able to vote for him in the Democratic primary.  When people actually get to listen to Bernie they like him, a lot.  This is shaping up to be 2008 all over again for Hillary and the third way, corporatist DCCC.  The message is loud and clear that Bernie doesn't dance around issues like the TPP ala Hillary.  It is refreshing to see someone emerge with their own ideas as opposed to the latest poll results."
