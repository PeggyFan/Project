In short, while the odds are still strong that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination (if not the general election thereafter), if she does get the nomination my prediction is that she will be a stronger and much more relevant candidate in the general election because Bernie made her think about what the Democratic party really is supposed to represent. That, in and of itself, is reason enough for me to support Bernie while he still has a chance."
1,"I think the press should cut Clinton some slack on the email issue. Most of us with at least a few years of professional work experience know better than to write any confidential information in text or email forms. We use the phone or meet in person. And that is what Mrs. Clinton did.Hillary Clinton, as a person who has been under constant scrutiny of everybody, knows more than anyone to leave a visible electronic trail.  Most of the email that she sent can probably be reconstructed if it really includes valuable information because all emails  have one or more recipients, and most of those copies are already on the State Department email server and may even be available on numerous public email servers if she sent mail to individual outside the Clinton private server."
2,"Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the MOST QUALIFIED PERSON to be the next President of the United States.  She is smarter, and knows more about politics and the world, than any other person running for the office and most people in the world.  We should have listened to her when she spoke of a vast right-wing conspiracy because it has nearly destroyed OUR democracy.  Ms. Rodham Clinton was a respected attorney when she became First Lady.  According to Wikipedia, ""She cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families in 1977, she became the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978, and became the first female partner at Rose Law Firm in 1979. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America.""  She was on  the front-line when there was a ""conservative"" backlash against women having equal rights in America.  She kept her head and went on to serve as Secretary of State to President Obama after he won the presidency that she sought - because she LOVES America.  And now she is doing us the honor of running for President again and has shown all of us what it is to be a tough, dedicated woman in America.  Every woman who is registered to vote in America MUST vote for her.  If you aren't registered get registered to vote for her.  She is simply the Best!"
3,"Vice President Biden has none of Mrs. Clinton's problems, which is a big advantage in the general election. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, he is likable and liked. He is a man of achievement and a man of honor. I don't say that Mrs. Clinton lacks either, but I do think that there is a regrettable perception amongst voters that Mrs. Clinton is not completely candid. Mr. Biden was a masterful legislator, too, and he knows how to get along with opposition politicians. He would be likely to be able to advance a progressive agenda and he would inspire confidence among the nation's allies because of his long experience in foreign affairs. Should he run, I think he would certainly cut into Mrs. Clinton's early support. It would make for a difficult race for the former secretary of state, who would have to contend with Senator Sanders on the progressive side of the party and Mr. Biden, who is universally loved by Democrats."
4,"Nothing -- well almost nothing -- could make me happier than to have Joe Biden run for president. We don't need another Clinton, and it would be good to have another president I could genuinely and wholeheartedly support. Run Joe, run!"
5,"Thank you, Ms. Sullivan for your comments.  On the plus side, consider the fact that the Times (rightfully so) is ashamed of this reporting.  Many other news agencies wouldn't bat an eye.This leads me to my next point.  The New York Times is one of the few remaining news organizations with global presence and credibility along with a proud history.  The paper, its editos and reporters, have an almost sacred charge to leave the paper better than they found it.True, that is hard to do in this age of hyper-competitve time stamping and sensationalism.  Still, that is the job.  If the staff feel they are contrained by the high standards of the TImes, they should look elsewhere.Here is something as well that may be difficult to fathom inside the news room.  Your readers do not care if you first to get the scoop.  We know that if the story is newsworthy, it will eventually get coverage in the TImes.  So in this age in which everything is covered and than there is infinitely more news than is digestible, we rely on the TImes to select the sotries that are important.  We also rely on the TImes to verify those stories and make sure that they are real.FInally, the damage done by this story is just beginning.  Stand by for relentless accounts from right wing crazies about how Clinton was scheduled to be arrested but the Clinton mafia assissinated all of the FBI agents involved to repress the story.  These people do not care that you offered corrections and retractions."
6,"I don't understand why Trump's supporters think he's so truthful. After every campaign appearance, Mr. Normal Guy from Nowhere, USA gets interviewed and says something like “Trump tells the truth no one else has the guts to say”, or some similar tripe. But, Trump thinks Mr. Normal Guy is a loser. As soon as Trump steps back inside his plane, he's forgotten Nowhere, USA and all the losers, and he will never think of them again. To him, the people of Nowhere, USA are completely inconsequential and insignificant. Don’t they know that?Trump's cockamamie ideas will go exactly nowhere if he's elected. Do Trump supporters really think that a big wall that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars is going to be constructed between the US and Mexico? Or, that the US is going to start deporting millions of immigrants? How can anyone really believe that? How naive are they? Trump supporters claim to like him because he's not a politician. But, just running for the presidency makes him a politician, and he's just as loathsome and insincere as any other politician.  Why anyone would listen to Trump and think he's honest is beyond my understanding. Why is it better if Donald Trump looks you in the eye and lies to you than if Hillary Clinton looks you in the eye and lies to you? Either way, you're a sucker for believing."
7,"Bernie is already on the left of Hilary - so, where would Joe be? On the left of Bernie, or somewhere between Bernie and Hilary? Neither would win him more votes than either Bernie or Hilary are going to get. Although he is certainly a likable candidate and would be a great president."
8,"It would be nice to read an article about Bernie Sanders that is not, in fact, about Hillary Clinton."
9,"MLK said something to the effect of:  We can't make white people like black people, but we can work to ensure that they stop lynching black people. Hilary is right - it is not possible to change all or even most hearts. But is is possible to demand reform in police departments across the country and to take political action to ensure that such reforms are enacted. Hopefully the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement will use the policy and political lessons learned during the Civil Rights to bring about the needed changes.  When I worked on women's issues in the 80's in California, women's groups had a specific legislative agenda that addressed numerous issues from lack of child support enforcement to lack of affordable day care.  A realistic policy and legislative agenda is needed in every state and at the national level to change the systems that allow and even encourage police violence against black people."
