0,"Since Bill Clinton left office and George W Bush, a Republican, took control fifteen years ago, the congress has for the most part been in the control of the Republican party. The laws that have passed or have been blocked because of Republican control. President Obama worked very hard to try to develop a constructive relationship with Boehner and McConnell, who promised ""bipartisanship"" and then spent the next eight years doing everything possible to block any kind of progress or positive movement, including from their own party. Budgets have been bloated each year by the Republicans, environmental controls originally sponsored by Richard Nixon, a Republican, were destroyed, education reform that was originally sponsored by Republicans was dismantled and immigration reform was blocked by the Republicans after multiple attempts at a reasonable solution.  Which means that the conditions that the current Republican candidates describe are nothing more a self review of the policies of the Republican party and those policies long term effects on the country and the world. Fifteen years of their way of doing business is quite enough.Anyone who votes for a Republican should have their head examined. You think the US is a ""hell hole"" now? Just pull the Republican lever and wait a few more years to see what McConnell, Boehner, or any of the presidential candidates would do. "
1,"I agree with most of Krugman's current post.  Bush wants to lower top income tax rates---the top rate of 39.6% on income above $464,850 would be replaced by a lower top rate of 28% on income above $163,800, according to the Bloomberg article.  This would be offset by fewer tax deductions.  the result would be lower taxes for most taxpayers.  Bush seems to believe the lower taxes would stimulate the economy, leading to a higher rate of economic growth.But his proposed tax plan runs in exactly the opposite direction to professed concern among Republicans for ""balancing the budget,"" unless it is accompanied by truly draconian cuts to the federal budget.  And it would increase disparity between rich and poor, particularly since the rich would still not pay social security taxes on any income above $118,500.This is a tax plan meant to appeal to the very wealthy, including the donor class.  Bush's plan seems to be: appeal to the wealthy, who will bankroll an advertising campaign that will sell Jeb Bush as the savior of poor Americans and the champion of ""family values.""  It seems based upon getting the uninformed to vote against their own self-interest.Thank God for Trump.  He would most likely be a disaster as president, his interviews reveal a shallow understanding of foreign affairs, and his pointless attacks on Megyn Kelly and Carly Fiorina antagonize potential voters.  But his campaign demonstrates how far the Republican establishment has drifted from its own base."
2,"Trump is hurting Christie, Cruz, Paul, and Santorum because those 4 would tend to be bullying and/or outrageous in their demeanor but they can't compete with the uber-brashness of the reality TV star (calling Trump a builder or entrepreneur or businessman at this point would be merely referencing his earlier career).However, the reality is that Trump hurts Bush more than anyone. Trump is destroying the Republican brand. Everyday that Trump carries on is a day lost to Bush. Every voter who adheres to Trump is a voter lost to Bush. Permanently. Trump is putting on a great show, and those voters who are drawn to it will not be satisfied by the vanilla Jeb! "
3,"If Mr. Bush's command of Spanish is ""fluent"" and ""flawless,""  it's much better than his English."
4,"Isn't it time for columnists to start writing about the runner-ups to Clinton and Trump, i.e., Bernie Sanders and Ben Carson?  Both need examination.  Will Sanders emerge as the 2nd to Clinton?  Is Dr. Carson ready to be president?  Given Ms. Dowd's premise that Americans don't want another Bush or Clinton dynasty,  that Trump is unsuitable and Joe Biden may not even run,  can we please turn to whom might logically replace Clinton and Bush as candidates? "
5,"""For example, the main point of Social Security is to make it possible for people to retire — that is, to work fewer hours.""This is false math. People work very, very hard -- and long hours -- and then at a certain point, they retire. Look at the more than middle-aged woman at the check-out counter at Waldbaum's or Shop Rite: Do you really expect her to stand like that for all those hours when she's seventy years old?Raising the retirement age does not force people to work ""longer hours"" -- it makes them work more years. If Jeb Bush wants people to work more, and more people to work -- the latter a very good thing indeed -- then he needs to revise the tax code so that American corporations find it to their advantage to bring back to America their manufacturing jobs.And if Americans can only get over their desire to purchase a lot of crap for nothing, and instead bought fewer, but better-made, items, perhaps we really could have more people working, more tax revenue, and a better functioning society."
6,"The federal government now employs 2.7 million people (excluding the military). Jeb would like to unemploy 10% of those people and destroy 270,000 jobs.Not since July 1966 has the federal government’s workforce been as small as today's 2.7 million when we our population was much, much less. As a share of the total workforce, the federal government’s share of civilian employment is the lowest since World War II.Currently, 15.7% of workers are employed by either federal, state or local governments. You have to go back to 1960 to find a government workforce as small as we have today.Jeb would like to make government even more dysfunctional than it is now by shrinking its payroll; this will complement the Republican dream of drowning government in a bathtub through endless tax cuts for the wealthy.Jeb wants bad government at all costs by starving and strangling it in any possible way.This is good for rich people who don't want any accountability from a well-funded government and a disaster for most Americans as oligarchs continue run wild over American bodies and the environment.Jeb's plan is a third-rate plan for a third-world country.Keep Jeb! unemployed in 2016."
7,"The Bush family has actually been in national elective office for 20 years since 1981. George H.W. was vice-president for 8 yrs, president for 4 and G.W. was, of course, president for 8. On a percentage basis, we've had a Bush as vice-president or president for 59% of the time since 1981 till now, 20 out of 34 yrs.The first Bush would never have made it to national office except for, one, being the wealthy son of a U.S. senator with an Ivy League degree (he had a distinguished war record, but so did thousands of others who served in WW II). He lost his senate race in Texas in 1970, but Nixon called him to DC and there followed a series of jobs, giving him a record in office far longer than Thomas Jefferson or other great notables in American history.Nixon resuscitated the career of the first Bush, then Reagan picked him for vice-president after NBC invited Bob Dole to speak on a live television hook-up with Reagan and Dole told the future nominee, ""Stop lying about my record."" After the vice-presidency, this led to the White House for Bush, which led to G.W. being elected governor of Texas once Karl Rove had transformed him which, in turn, led to the second Bush at 1600 Pa. Avenue.So, Jeb Bush says ""We need to help politicians rediscover life outside of Washington""? Who should start, Jeb? Any volunteers?"
8,"It is abundantly clear by now that George W. Bush is more intelligent than his brother Jeb.However, Jeb is leading every other candidate in fundraising. Perhaps because, as others have noted, he appears to have changed his name to Jeb !, or Jeb! An exclamation point instead of, Bush, at least at this point in his campaign. Hope springs eternal."
9,I thought Jeb was supposed to be the smart one.
