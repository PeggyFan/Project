1,"Ross, I'd love for once to hear you talk about substance in the Republican candidates. For example, I'd honestly be interested in hearing what you find interesting in Paul and Rubio as far as regenerating the Repub party. <br/><br/>What I'd REALLY love to hear from you, though, is how you can live with the frankly nutty stuff and its current dominance in your party—people who don't believe in evolution, who regularly denigrate science, who have a poor education or ignorance of the world (like the TP congressional candidate who, when asked what our stance should be towards Saudi Arabia, said that ""we should have free trade with them""), who believe that 47% of the nation is on some kind of welfare, who don't acknowledge the failures of our healthcare system but claim the ACA has ""death panels"", and so on. <br/><br/>These are not minor threads: It's a rare Repub candidate who'll depart from the party line in these things—say, who argues against the ACA for substantive reasons while backing anything at all to help ordinary people get care. And shutting the government down to try to un-pass a duly-passed law is pretty extreme and loony as well. <br/><br/>We know you're intelligent and thoughtful, Ross. So how do you see these things? How can you live with a party that promotes them? The lack of Repubs speaking out against birthers doesn't shame you? The prospect of Ted Cruz or Michelle Bachmann as a candidate does not alarm you?

2,"Not only is Clinton likely to go further to the right than Obama, given her track record and her support of Wall Street, but she will also be like ""waving a red flag in front of a bull"" (to echo Boehner's recent use of this phrase) and will generate the same level of mindless opposition that Obama has engendered.  First you had a black man born in Kenya for President, now let's have the white woman responsible for Vince Foster's death run to succeed him.  Not going to work very well.  Even if she is ellected.  There will be mindless opposition regardless of the policies she promotes.  For example, who doubts that Mitt Romney could have passed something like the Affordable Care Act, as a successor to Massachusett's implementation of the same system?  After all, Obamacare was a Repulbican idea.  It only was opposed because the right was prejudiced against Obama.  Clinton's proposals would suffer the same fate.

Washington saw the largest decline in turnout at 25.1% 2014 against 2010. The majority of States were down.

4,"I'll repeat my prediction here, first made on election night 2014, that, in spite of their overwhelming victory, the GOP has not basically changed from a party which lives from, fosters and perpetuates, social conflict and political ignorance through the multitude of ""nut cases"" in its midst. <br/><br/>There is no ""reform conservative"" renewal of the GOP, as much as Douthart and Brooks would like to talk it into existance. To think that Marco Rubio is the best the GOP might have to offer in 2016 is just too pathetic for words.<br/><br/>The ""nut cases"" in the GOP, including Cruz (and Huckabee, btw) will dominate the primaries and will continue to make the GOP a laughing stock on the national level. And with their current majority in both houses, the GOP will continue to pound away at repealing ACA, and will focus on devisive issues to feed the ignorance and prejudices of their core constituents, and thus fail the test of actually governing at the national level.<br/><br/>Having supported Hillory Clinton in 2008 until the ""bitter end"", even I am not enthused by the prospect of her candidacy in 2016 (her statements on Syria recently demostrate a complete unawareness of our mistakes in the Middle East), but in a face-off between Hillary and Marco Rubio (or Paul Rand), she will be obviously the superior candidate, in intellectual capacity, experience and stature.",,20,"Seattle, Munich",False,58268518,1415814933

Both executed with horrifying efficiency. Both initially ignored by the western powers.<br /><br />The only difference is that the Jews will keep this horrid episode in the human psyche for many more years. As precautionary means the value of such endeavor is essential to the human race, however, I hope we are not enshrining these horrible events in our savage history in a Genocide Hall of Fame with points to be awarded based only on number of books written about any such event.<br /><br />On the other hand, Slavery, while it may not have instituted murder as its ends its adherents did not shy away from killing those that opposed it. This period of our history similarly required of a citizenry the suspension of reason in order to legitimize the dehumanization of individuals based on skin color or provenance to the point of making the slave owners the ultimate word on life or death for their negroes and compounded the immoral proceedings by adding the prospect of personal profit on the basis of another being's life.<br /><br />All of these events are beyond reasonable excuse and deserve equal disdain from anyone who values human life in all its colors, genders, ages, creeds and ethnic divergences. To utilize any of these as a trump card in achieving political upsmanship devalues the human suffering and trivializes the ability of mankind to commit horrible crimes against its own.<br />",,2,"New York, NY",False,40750055,1267550375
9,"Podesta (#39) –<br /><br />I think you deliberately misunderstand the whole point of my post.  I am not sure how you can interpret “no question that slavery in America was horrible” as a racist comment.  Please try to put things into perspective.  Hyperbole tends to get you in trouble with the facts.  That is the material point.<br /><br />That you dismiss all other slavery that has ever existed (and still exists) in the world as second rate or “not real” in comparison to slavery in America is just plain wrong.  My basic argument here is that you afford other slaves throughout history that same level of understanding that you demand for the American disaster.  Your problem lies in starting with the conclusion that other slaves in other places and times weren’t “really” slaves in your opinion.  That, sir, is insensitive on your part.<br /><br />Even if we take your opinion as fact (this being a debate – hopefully among friends), the purchase of slaves from the West Cost of Africa through triangular trade was not unique to the North American colonies.  Though you are convinced of your convictions, it does you no good to label anyone who may disagree with you as “Neo-Confederate” – especially since it is so obviously intended as an insult.  You diminish the validity of your otherwise legitimate arguments by unbecoming cheap shots.<br /><br />You demand that anyone who disagrees should buy and read the books you cite, but you cite no sources in your diatribe.  Though I am admittedly not an expert by any stretch, my opinions on the horrors of American slavery come from historians such as Jim McPherson, Ed Ayers, and others whose expertise is in the American Civil War and who list slavery as its primary cause. I’ve read slave narratives, such as “Slavery Remembered”, and have a dog-eared copy of “Before Freedom Came” on my shelf.  I simply disagree with your belittlement of all other slavery throughout the whole of human existence. It is, on your part, hyperbole at its worst, and THAT is my point.<br /><br />In the end, this whole discussion is about whether public figures ought to engage in pop-referencing slavery and the Holocaust for dramatic affect.

10,"This blog and some of the comments are a reminder of how much discrimination and anti-semitism there is in the world. If you can't understand why these comparisons are a problem, it's because you haven't experienced discrimination. If you think people are overly sensitive or need to ""get over it,"" you must be a white, Christian male.<br /><br />My personal experience with discrimination: I am Scottish/Welsh but my husband's family, as far back as the family tree can be traced 18th century, on both sides is French/Irish/Catholic--with the exception of a German man (early 20th century) who married into the family and happened to have had a Jewish sounding name, although he was also Catholic.<br /><br />Since him only sons have been born into the family, which has carried that German surname through to the current generation.<br /><br />When people meet me for the first time they ask if my husband is Jewish. If they've never met me before and have only seen my name (business correspondence etc), they automatically assume I am Jewish because of my surname. And that assumption always has negative connotations, unless the person asking is Jewish.<br /><br />My husband and I know little of the Jewish faith or culture, but we certainly sympathize with Jews and others who are discriminated against solely because of their surnames, race, gender, etc.<br /><br />What are all of you white men afraid of?",,0,Saint Louis,False,51193491,1267418083
11,"Virginia, both you and Michael are in denial in a way different from that of a blazing bigot like Rep. Franks, but quite offensive.<br /><br />You said:  ""While there is no question that slavery in America was horrible, you are in no position to suggest that slavery in ancient Egypt or Rome were not as harsh, painful, or humiliating to the people suffering through it.""<br /><br />Actually, I am.  ""Chattel"" slavery means treating people as if they are property, no different from a chair or cow.  Bondage in Egypt and Rome was not chattel slavery.  That form of exploitation arose as part of the European expansion to and colonization of the New World.  The massive amount of labor needed to produce crops and other exports sent back to Europe became a justification for the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  Russian serfdom, the control of land by  the aristocracy, is not comparable to chattel slavery.  Serfs were not considered non-human or property.  Sexual slavery?  As commenter laura174 notes, it was a major part of chattel slavery.<br /><br />Both you and Michael are dismissive of chattel slavery being the biggest stain on world history for centuries because admitting it is implicates white people and that is not acceptable to you. You would like to see the victims blamed or an equal pointing of fingers.  But, the facts do not support that.  Rep. Franks takes the denial a step further by claiming slavery was beneficial, as does the commenter 'Charles B. Tiffany,' a name often seen at neo-Confederate and other racist websites.  His apocryphal claim of an 1860 census showing black men had life spans nearly equivalent to white men is of course, nonsense, as is the claim of blacks being off under slavery he is promoting.<br /><br />I cited several excellent historians who have studied American slavery above.

We should all know the limits of horror to see it in a continuum, rather than isolated events.<br /><br />As for the health-care debate, our present system is untenable. With 50 million Americans uninsured while insurance-company profits crest, we have created a system that denies adequate care to more and more people for a profit motive. In Texas (of all places), deliberately doing nothing when someone is grievously injured is legally tantamount to murder. So with health insurers routinely using rescission of policies and other chicanery to deny coverage (and hence care) to their insureds should be seen as what it is--legally tantamount to murder. It turns a profit, while the whole apparatus of the Final Solution did not, and ultimately contributed to Germany's collapse through the gross waste of human potential (and lives), misuse of human beings, transport, and materiel--all for the promulgation of a perverse political agenda.<br /><br />Scapegoating one or more groups of people for political expediency has been done all of the time, and is simply WRONG.

36,"governorjose -- Apparently you don't understand my point on turning the filibuster table on the Republicans. The filibuster is MORE leverage than a majority and the Democrats only need 40 out 53 members to threaten one. That means less cat herding.<br /><br />So start by holding no more votes this year because 'a compromise couldn't be reached.' The pressure to do something soon then begins.<br /><br />Next year, the Republicans House will start passing bills that the Senate must also pass. At that point, it will be possible to hold up a vote on tax cuts until other matters are settled. The Democrats are still the ones who call the shots there. I assert that the public will not have patience for Republicans refusal to extend UI benefits unless the rich get a tax cut. They will not have patience for a government shut down unless the rich get a tax cut. The Democrats can wait the Republicans out. 74% of Americans don't want the rich to get a tax cut. Nothing could be clearer. DADT repeal first, START next, UI benefits extension next, then two separate tax cut votes. Or all the tax cuts expire. Period. Because the Republicans insisted on their 'holy grail.' Then, in fairly short order, they'll cave. Optics improved.<br /><br />It's called a stance to negotiate from. It's called 'your tax cuts caused huge deficits and we can't afford them.' It's called 'let's see who blinks first in this Mexican stand-off' instead of 'I blinked before I even knew what was on the table, just like you wanted, Mr. McConnell.'<br /><br />Here are other areas I believe you are wrong on:<br /><br />The Democrats didn't want the tax cuts to lapse on any income except that over 250K.<br /><br />These tax cuts will be made permanent after they've been a campaign issue that Republicans will effectively appeal to their base on in 2012. They'll ask voters, 'If tax cuts are a bad idea, why did the President extend them last year?'<br /><br />The payroll tax reduction ballyhooed by the President will be made permanent also, dooming SS.<br /><br />Large parts of HIR will be effectively defunded because the deficit neutrality of the legislation depended on ending the Bush tax cuts.<br /><br />The President isn't spineless...he's getting the pragmatic (read: conservative) things that he wanted all along.<br /><br />The banks that were too big to fail...are now bigger, handing out the same bonuses, accounting for toxic assets by marking-to-fantasy in a game of extend and pretend, and are going to get bailed out again.<br /><br />He's restructured very little unless the new $14/hour rate for new UAW hirees is restructuring.<br /><br />Civilians want a repeal of DADT. Elderly military brass wants to keep it. So far, we're keeping it. Who controls what, now?<br /><br />I'm glad to have the debate. I respect your views. I heartily enjoy your comments. But these tax cuts for the rich will be counterproductive as both anti-stimulus in the form of more money chasing risk rather than being spent by consumers, and as additions to the deficit.<br /><br />",,0,Ann Arbor,False,59793377,1291771158

I have to disagree with you - if the only leverage they have now is that they control a lame-duck session of Congress, how much leverage can they expect by putting it off even further when they don't?  If herding Republicans is like herding lemmings, herding Democrats is like herding cats, and there is no telling what the environment is going to be like in six months.  Remember how the economy was supposed to have recovered by now to where letting the tax cuts lapse would be an easy sell?  Don't get me wrong - I think they should all lapse.  But the reality has changed.  Republicans wanted to make them permanent.  Democrats wanted them to lapse.  They've been temporarily extended - sounds like a meeting in the middle to me, which, frankly, is more than I was hoping to expect.  And I absolutely have to disagree, with all respect, with you that DADT repeal and START ratification are feasible next Congress.  Just won't happen.<br /><br />As for your contention that Obama has shown no backbone, again, disagreement.  He's forced out auto and bank CEOs, restructured entire industries, asserted civilian command over the military, pushed through landmark legistlation (any of it perfect? No, but leagues better than nothing), and put in place a top-to-bottom re-strengthening of government oversight, regulation, and standards undoing the damage of Reaganism.  And this issue isn't going away - he's set it up to be the chief issue in his re-election campaign. I remember David Frum writing back when health reform passed how Republicans actually committed a grave error in not participating in shaping it, because now it was law.  When you have the means to have a say, you should take it.  Obama's no LBJ, but I didn't vote for LBJ.  He's a pragmatist, and I have to say that's the person I want in charge right now.  Show me a leader who hasn't compromised his values in order to govern, and I'll show you the dustbin of history.<br /><br />Bob, thanks for the comment, though I'm pretty sure we're still coming at things from opposite poles.

Bernie Sanders voted against the deal on the philosophical grounds that granting a tax cut extension to the highest income bracket (as the Republicans in congress had halted a bill to grant only the low-middle range cuts) was fiscally untenable, and a moral wrong. You're welcome to dispute his philosophy if you so wish, but his objections were the dramatic opposite of DeMint and Coburn, who wanted still more cuts in taxes- the estate tax in particular. Not all dissent is ideologically equivalent. Coburn and DeMint explicitly wanted more unfunded tax cuts, yet you gloss over this and make it seem as if the three men hold comparable views on fiscal responsibility.<br /><br />Further, about Hitchens' ""hobby-horse"" of the Catholic sex abuse scandal- I'm afraid you're drawing a pretty staggering false equivalence between the complaints of many in the Tea Party (at least so much as their collective will can be interpreted, given that it's a highly diffuse and scattered movement) and those of critics of the Church. If there was credible evidence to suggest that Barack Obama had, at some point in his career, learned information relating to the molestation or rape of a child, and it was clear that he had done absolutely anything other than turning this information over to the presiding civil law authorities, fair enough. Have him impeached like so many of the bumper-stickers say.<br /><br />But that's not Barack Obama, that's the pope. Argue to me that he didn't explicitly request leniency for the pedophiles in his flock, and I'd disagree with you, but even if you honestly believe this you ignore a crucial truth; that anything short of full disclosure and cooperation with law enforcement the moment you know of such a thing is a greater moral crime than anything you could dream up to accuse the President of. Manufactured hysteria over health care reform (which if you insist on tethering to a person's name is much more Baucus-care than Obama-care, though I grant you that's not as politicaly convenient a label) is not the intellectual equivalent of wanting child rapists to be brought to justice, and to not feel as if a religious institution is flagrantly skirting both our nation's laws, and humanity's moral ones.<br /><br />Nor is it comparably righteous to sit on your hands throughout eight years of the Bush administrations' torrential financial expenditures, and then grab the rifle and the pocket-sized copy of the Constitution because the Democrat is in office.

But Germany is fine, France is considering raising retirement to an age we would consider paradisiacal, and Iceland had the proper reaction to their debt:  they defaulted because a sovereign nation does not have to cover the bets of others.

Unfortunately, there isn't a single thing that can be done about it.<br /><br />Media influences peoples' political views more than anything else. Everyone likes to think of him/herself as an independent thinker, but in reality most peoples' viewpoints are dictated by the narrative created by the media. The most influential type of media is broadcast media - television and radio.<br /><br />Because these outlets are subject to private control, we've arrived at the expected outcome; the most wealthy interests have the greatest influence. The financial sector, oil and gas, health insurance, etc - because of their influence, you're never going to see one of the large networks truly oppose any message they want to promote. Sure, people like Keith Olbermann are allowed to shout for an hour or two and make people think that ""both sides"" have a voice. But in reality, no ""news"" network is willing to point out when something a politician or other public figure says is wrong and stick with that message. A good example is the ""debate"" over how to stimulate the economy. The data exists that *proves* tax cuts of any kind are a very inefficient way to stimulate the economy. Food stamps are #1, followed closely by social welfare and infrastructure spending. And it doesn't really take an economist to understand why this is the case. But *no one* brings this up.<br /><br />The only way to fix this would be to keep broadcast media under public control. This would obviously never happen - there's no way most people would agree with ""GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF THE MEDIA OH MY GOD 1984!""

Frankly, the response from Vermonters and Americans all across the country – like you – was far beyond anything we could have imagined. As of this writing, we received a total of more than 10,000 phone calls and 9,324 e-mails. More than 98 percent of the responses were in opposition.<br /><br />In my view, this huge outpouring of concern was not just about this harmful bill. It went deeper than that. It was a cry from the middle class who are deeply worried about the future of our country and where this agreement, and similar type bills, will lead us in the years to come.<br /><br />At a time when we have a $13.7 trillion national debt and the most unfair distribution of income in the industrialized world, why are we giving huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires? Is there no end to their greed? And does anyone really believe that this will only be a two-year agreement with no future extensions?<br /><br />Why should we be significantly lowering rates on the estate tax when it applies only to the very, very richest people in this country, the top 0.3 percent?  The richest 1 percent already owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.  Isn't that enough?<br /><br />With the American people deeply worried about the future of Social Security, why are we diverting $112 billion from the Social Security trust fund in order to provide a 'payroll tax holiday?' Why is a Democratic president adopting this position, which has long been held by Republicans who want to eventually destroy Social Security by choking off its funds? With the Republicans coming to power in the House in a few weeks, why should anyone not think that this 'one-year' diversion will be made long-term or permanent? According to one major senior citizen organization, this action could be the beginning of the end for Social Security – the most successful anti-poverty program in the history of the United States.<br /><br />It goes without saying that we must extend unemployment benefits for the millions of working families who, in the midst of this terrible recession, are about to see them expire. But why is this considered a 'concession' when for the last four decades Democrats and Republicans have always worked together and agreed that benefits must be continued when the unemployment rate is higher than 7.2 percent.  This is not a 'concession' on the part of the Republicans. This is a continuation of long-held, bipartisan policy.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe that we could have reached and should reach a better agreement that represents the interests of middle class and working families of our country.<br /><br />Let's keep working together.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />BERNARD SANDERS<br />United States Senator<br />",,8,"Healdsburg, CA",False,58191683,1292863869

It is neither mathematical algorithms nor human psychology that buried in the social and financial environments.<br /><br />Fresh water and salt water may sound posterior probability that we have come through the evolutional stage on values that we craved for the free-market system that trade had made currencies available; and monetarism that governments intervened in promoting the best environments to trade or preserve. Apparently, many saw threats in their survival; and their reaction became irrational to the current stage on value. We are on the beyond of the Darwinism of economics of the past; and the measurement of value is approaching toward another trail to survive. What can we account on to survive if the free-market system and monetarism failed?<br /><br />It is not the system that makes us disbelieve since we are adaptive; but how we will make to accept the alternative to survive from the servicing of the evolutional value we rely on now.

168,"Hello, Bernie, I have been waiting for some time for your excellent rejoinder to the capitalist dictatorship. Now you have started to launch a good fight against the wrongdoers who have usurped the power of the representative democracy of the people for so long. In support of your efforts, I am enclosing one of my recent comments below:<br /><br />Without reading the contents of these two books, by Newt Gingrich and Jim DeMint on socialism,  one can easily conclude that none of these two men knows anything about socialism, let alone about stopping the U.S. from going socialism. Ever since WW I the capitalist class of this country had started to fight against and vilified socialism deliriously with good reason – socialism means death of capitalism. During the Cold War period, they fought even more madly and this time against not only the concept but also the regimes of socialism – the Soviet Union in 1917 and later on, China, in 1949, etc. Did they succeed in overthrowing them? The answer is NO, they did not and could not overthrow them and these regimes simply internally disintegrated without external military attack at all. The first lesson we learn from the anti-socialism history is that capitalism cannot defeat socialism.  Socialism has, by and in itself, a very powerful living capability.<br /><br />The next obvious question is, if socialism were so strong internally, why the socialist regimes would disintegrate and fold one after the other like dominos. Well, the answer has to come from the contradictions deeply involved in the lines of thought and politics of socialism. Socialism is the very first socio-political system in the history of societal development of human kind that breaks away from the private property owning system, which has lasted for many thousands of years. Socialist revolution could destroy the ancien régimes politically but could not as easily change the old habits, thoughts, culture, private-ownership penchants and bourgeois ideology as change those already corrupted old regimes. The old and new lines of thoughts in a socialist regime are constantly in fighting with each other. Similarly, the old and new lines of politics – restorative political line back to capitalism vs. revolutionary political line moving forward against restoration – are also constantly in fighting. These contradictions eventually escalated to the level of antagonism and the capitalist restoration forces with tremendously strong help from the conservative, backward thinking and the residual hostile party members usurped the political power. Socialism got self-destroyed and died a sudden death. The second lesson learned is that socialism constantly faces the danger of capitalist restoration.<br /><br />Newt Gingrich claims that Obama is running a so-called Secular-Socialist Machine. That is a carping lie. Obama is such a blue-blood capitalist henchman that he will do anything and everything fighting against socialism for his capitalist masters. He dare not let even a shred of socialist dirt near him. Only third class oafish politicians like Gingrich can become so cunning as to conjure up such drivel shamelessly. Ditto for Jim DeMint. On the other hand, politicians of the two parties, including Gingrich, DeMint and Obama, have been shamelessly lying to the working people of the U.S. about the true political policy and lines of their sinister practices and planning – state-assisted socialism for the capitalists and Dickensian capitalism for the working people.<br /><br />The ideal of socialism as a scientific theory has been with us for 162 years since Karl Marx and Frederick Engels published their Manifesto in 1848 in England. Why has such a specter been haunting Europe and now the world? Something must be right about it. That something is none other than the fact that capitalism as a historical period of civilization has finished its mission and been in the throes of anti-capitalist revolution. Let me quote Robert McChesney and John Foster in “Capitalism, the Absurd System – A view from the United States” that says, “Capitalism is an economic, political and social system based on private ownership of property, business and industry, and directed towards making the great possible profits for successful organizations and people.” By absurd it means, “1: ridiculously unreasonable, unsound, or incongruous . 2: having no rational or orderly relationship to human life: MEANINGLESS ; also: lacking order or value .” <a href=""http://monthlyreview.org"" target=""_blank"">http://monthlyreview.org</a><br /><br />The third lesson learned is therefore that capitalism cannot be reformed or revitalized. Its incessant crises prove its end is not far away. When the whole world is in the throes of socialist revolution, six billion people’s struggle in solidarity will assure its final victory.<br /><br />",,2,"Colesville, MD",False,56549585,1292898986

201,"What do the State of the Union, the Tiger Mother, and former D.C. school chancellor Michelle Rhee have in common? They’re all saying the same thing.<br /><br />Amy Chua, aka the “Tiger Mother,” has gotten a lot of press and taken a lot of slack recently. But she has also struck a nerve. As Time magazine recently put it, “Think of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother as a well-timed taunt aimed at our own complacent sense of superiority, our belief that America will always come out on top.” She has motivated millions of parents to ask themselves if they really do have high enough expectations for their children.<br /><br />Another child of American immigrants and the former chancellor of the D.C. public school system, Michelle Rhee, has also enjoyed recent press attention. She’s not talking about parenting, though; she’s talking about schools. Her new organization, Students First, has embarked upon the humble task of fixing America’s broken educational system by “challenging the bureaucracy” and “putting students first.” Michelle Rhee is building on what research now shows: the best teachers aren’t necessarily the smartest or the most experienced; they’re the ones with the highest expectations for their students—the ones who set the biggest goals for their classrooms. They come to school every day thinking, “How will I move my students five grade levels ahead in reading by the end of the year,” not, “Which grammar lesson am I going to pull out of the binder today?”<br /><br />Amy Chua is saying about good parenting the same thing Michelle Rhee is saying about teaching. Set high expectations, and push yourself as an adult to make sure your child or student lives up to those expectations. It’s about the kid, not the parent or the teacher. Do you think Amy Chua enjoyed drilling Lulu nonstop for a week until she learned “The Little White Donkey”? Would it have been easier to let Lulu watch TV? You bet. Is it easier for teachers to whip out a boilerplate lesson plan and to pretend their students are soaking in what they’re teaching? Absolutely. Chua and Rhee agree: adults’ laziness sabotages children’s success, and in America, we let adults get away with laziness way too often.<br /><br />One thing is for sure: Amy Chua has long known that she couldn’t count on her children’s schools and teachers to raise them. That’s why she did extra math lessons, extra music lessons, extra everything at home. That’s why Ian Ayres, a colleague of Chua’s at Yale Law School, insists on “daddy school” six days a week and over the summer. They know they can’t rely on schools to get the job done.<br /><br />Sadly, most parents in America aren’t like Amy Chua or Ian Ayres. They aren’t investing in their children. They’re leaving it up to the schools and complaining when their kids don’t advance. Barak Obama lamented this tragedy last night in his State of the Union address, when he said that the responsibility for developing our children “begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.”<br /><br />And sadly, most teachers in America aren’t like Teach for America’s Charles Taylor, featured recently in The Atlantic (“What Makes a Great Teacher?”). Instead, they complain about how hard it is to teach these days, what with all the testing and behavioral problems they have to deal with. They sit back and enjoy their tenure and their benefits packages and blame parents for problem children in their classrooms. That’s why Michelle Rhee has developed an organization that gives students—not just teachers’ unions—a voice. This voice is calling for pay structures that reward effective teaching, abolition of the tenure system, and the recruitment of teachers who aren’t just teachers, but leaders. Last night, Obama channeled Rhee as much as he did Chua. He reminded us that schools share the responsibility of raising our nation’s children with their parents: “When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many schools don’t meet this test.”<br /><br />If America will only listen, Michelle Rhee and Amy Chua have a powerful lesson to teach us: raise our expectations for our children, stop making excuses for not pushing ourselves to push our children harder, and America will be the America Barak Obama talked about last night. Guess what will happen in 2035? Children born in 2011 will have grown up and entered the workforce. By 2035, will we have “out-educated” the rest of the world? Will we have answered Obama’s question, “whether all of us—as citizens, and as parents—are willing to do what’s necessary” to develop the next generation, in the affirmative?<br /><br />Our parents and our teachers—more than anyone else—can be our “nation builders.” That’s Amy Chua’s message to parents.

216,"An inspiring speech. Mr. Obama gets an “A” for oratory. We’ve had lots of inspiring speeches in the past few decades, but our government is increasingly incapable of leading the people according to any sound principles.<br />Today, the average American pays about 40% in taxes (federal, state and local). That means for every 3 days you work for yourself and your family, you must work 2 days for the government. Or go to prison. The 13th Amendment says “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime...shall exist within the United States.” Working two days a week to support the government may not be slavery, but it certainly qualifies as “involuntary servitude.”<br />The 4th Amendment to our Constitution says, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, and in their houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated…” The government has no right to know our personal affairs, including how much money we make or how we earn or spend it. Yet, come tax time every year, we are forced to reveal the details of our personal finances. Or go to prison. Is this the freedom so many Americans have fought and died for?<br />How much should we pay in taxes? That depends on what we expect of government. Projects such as interstate highway systems, management of natural resources, and national defense clearly merit taxpayer support. Others, such as our counterproductive never-ending “wars” on terror, poverty, and drugs clearly do not.  And worthy projects such as Social Security and healthcare are being pathetically bungled, bankrupting our nation.<br />It would be bad enough if the government was only spending what we’ve already earned. But today, our government is squandering our future incomes, and those of our children and grandchildren. Our federal government is now spending so much that it must borrow 41 cents of every dollar it spends. It has indebted every man, woman and child in America by $45,600. Our government is leading us straight toward national bankruptcy and impoverishment.<br /> We can’t fix this by ""throwing out the bums"" and voting in new ones. We’ve tried that.  Republicans or Democrats--Coke or Pepsi.  The problem is that our government has an inherent tendency to grow every larger, create ever more complex laws and bureaucracies, and insidiously nibble away our rights and liberties.<br />The modest and reasonable government our founders envisioned has become a reckless, profligate, out-of-control behemoth that is trampling our constitutional rights, prying into our personal affairs, subjecting us to forced servitude, squandering our prosperity, and spending 67% more money than it is taking in. As currently constituted, it's beyond fixing. Is that not obvious by now?<br />We came to America to find a better life and build a better world. Now we must continue that project with new vigor and resolve.  In the words of our Founders in 1776:<br />“We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness… that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”<br />Let us begin.<br />",,1,"Eureka Springs, Arkansas",False,54757491,1296051920

The super-wealthy, now, own more of ""the pie"" than people of the past with names like ""Rockefeller"", ""Hearst"" and ""Vanderbilt"". Yet, it's still not enough to get them spending on employing more Americans. Where are the traffic tunnel projects or dams with rich people's names on them? New hospital wings, university buildings, research centers or bridges? Even though the super-rich in America are richer than they've ever been, they act like selfish and irresponsible renters, smashing-up the property with total disregard before they move-on to somewhere else. Why invest in something that has yet to compeletely belong to them?<br /><br />In this respect, the modern rich have given the ultimate slap to the masses, by essentially declaring that they no longer care about our envy, fear or awe. They are now so socially removed from the lower classes, that the lower classes have become invisible, totally insignificant. They don't need us. We already gave them our largesse. They can make money elsewhere, while still living in a land that works to keep food safe for consumption and water clean. They don't care what we think about their names being on buildings or companies. We aren't worth the bother.

249,"Take the budget and divide it by the number of entities and individuals who pay taxes. Break the payers into classes and then compute (software programs, computers and math algorithms can handle this) what each class will pay as a percentage of income. Then divide the class contribution amount for each class by the number of entities and individuals to determine what each contribution amount is due. No deductions, no exemptions, no anything with this one caveat: if the entity or individual has no income then there is no contribution to cover the expense of government. Everyone and all entities benefit from government and all without exception must pay. And all persons must be included as full citizens; each citizen is given the right to vote when they reach the national age of majority (i.e. 18). Any entity that does any business in America is included and all their income is used to determine their class. Lower classes contribute 5% and the super rich pay 25% of income. The rates in between this range are 10%, 15%, 20%.<br/><br/>Instead of the false argument that by decreasing the taxes of the rich the economy will create jobs we have the real situation that where the peoples' real gross income increases the tax burden decreases for the real job makers: the middle class which buys the products that are integral to the GNP. <br/><br/>This simple plan is to the point. No special interests, no accountants and lawyers are needed to interpret the contribution amount and no deductions, loopholes, exemptions, would influence tax payers. Everyone pays and there is no more lobbying to get a tax break. Companies are freed from unnecessary government tax reporting burdens and are no longer influenced or have their business decisions distorted by the expected tax impact. <br/><br/>Taxes for everyone now paying taxes will decrease as all presently none tax paying entities and individuals are included on an equal and equitable basis.<br/><br/>We do not needs gangs of anything.

If our system were as efficient, we would save over $1.5 TRILLION each year, and the deficit would soon vanish.<br/><br/>2. One of the many myths propagated by conservatives is that our corporate taxes are high compared to other countries. It is true that our nominal rate of 35% is high, but because of loopholes, this figure is meaningless. A good parameter to look at is total corporate taxes actually paid divided by GDP because neither of these figures can be fudged by corporations. If you look at developed countries, you will see that Norway has the highest value at 12.5%. The US is tied with Turkey for the lowest at 1.8%.<br/><br/>3. In 1946 the debt was 120% of the GDP, It went straight down to about 32% in 1973. During this period 1946 - 1973 taxes on the Rich were much higher. Marginal rates were at least 70%; they were 93% under Eisenhower. The economy was better than what we now have. For example, median wages went up 3 times as fast as since 1973. CEO's earned 50 times what their workers earned; it is 500 times today. Staring in 1973, the percent of wealth and income taken by the richest 10%, 1%, and 0.1% has gone up at an ever increasing rate. <br/><br/>4. On the flip side, since 1900 the periods with the lowest marginal rates were the years leading up to 1929 and 2008. These were also the periods when economic inequality and speculation were the greatest and they led to disaster. When tax rates are high, since rich people hate to pay taxes, they leave their profits in their companies, pay their workers more, improve their means of production, and perhaps even hire more, but when rates are low, they take them out and ... speculate!

If it buys T-bills, then it lends to the federal government who spends it, presumably stimulating the economy due to a multiplier &gt;1.   If it deposits it in a bank, then the bank loans it to someone who spends it in a way that also stimulates the economy. Unless that someone may be the Fed due to excess reserve policy. But that is the Fed's policy not a corporation's and that is where your focus should be directed.<br/><br/>2) The share of revenue and cost generated overseas by an ""American"" company has grown enormously. More sales occur overseas, more wages and commissions are paid overseas etc. More taxes are paid overseas - companies are not operating tax free in foreign nations!

My own ""American"" firm has doubled the number of overseas locations, probably tripled the number of overseas employees, and as a result our minimum cash balance has increased 50%. Because I don't work for a C corp, none of this reflects any tax avoidance.  In fact foreign taxes are increasingly a larger proportion of my tax bill.  It's just business basics.

2010     $1.06 trillion<br/>

What she is not talking about, quite noticeably, is her plan to roll back Wall St. &amp; the big banks with regulation similar to Glass-Steagall which Bill decimated in 1999. Bill Clinton ran a more right-wing centrist government than Nixon or Eisenhower. How does Clinton expect voters to get behind her when her closest campaign advisers are Morgan Stanley banking CEOs or Monsanto lobbyists? How can she be perceived as a Dem. candidate when she isn't even courageous enough to make a statement about TPP as she doesn't want to offend her billionaire backers in Silicon Valley, Hollywood or Wall St.?

Japan is often called “our most important bilateral relationship” by foreign policy elites.  It remains, however, a closed and semi-mercantilist economy.  Take the auto sector as one example.  Economists have pointed out that Japan has no tariff barriers to automobiles entering its market.  They concluded, therefore, that the failure of Detroit to sell vehicles in Japan was all Detroit's fault--it just didn't make the right cars for the market.  When these same economists learned that there were innumerable non-trade barriers , they expressed astonishment that such barriers existed.   These barriers are tolerated by our negotiators not for purely economic reasons but because of the U.S. government's  geo-political strategies in East Asia.

Mr. Franken noted that Elizabeth Warren, although great, is not running. A few days before, former progressive candidate darling of the left, Howard Dean, also endorsed Ms. Clinton. <br/><br/>Ms. Clinton is a centrist with many on Wall Street completely willing to bankroll her campaign. Not only will her policies be similar to President Obama, the polarization she causes among the right will be even more intense than it was for Obama because she and her husband, the ever-popular Bill, have a lot of bad blood between them and the Republicans, who carry a long memory of what happened in during Bill's two terms as President. Not only is very little going to change after 2016, it will likely get worse. <br/><br/>This may be the new Gilded Age, but there is no big progressive movement anywhere on the horizon other than in the major metropolitan centers, and the leadership of most of these is almost delusional in its approaches and belief systems. For example, Mayor de Blasio is the most inept mayor of New York City in at least 25 years, maybe even longer.

Hooray for Subway.  They've had a Veggie Delite for years (just omit the offered cheese and limit certain condiments/dressings and you have a vegan sandwich.) And to those readers who diss veganism:  any dietary preference has its pitfalls and requires education and vigilance in choosing a well-balanced menu. There are probably many vegans who are deficient in certain essential nutrients and as many omnivores whose kidneys are overloaded from the massive amounts of protein consumed on a daily basis. Eating a well-balanced diet requires more than simply choosing one lifestyle over the other and then eating whatever one pleases.  Furthermore, consuming a plant-based diet often evolves from a conscientious choice to follow the ancient Vedic principle of ahimsa or non-harming in one's life. The health benefits, and they are evident, are often secondary to making that decision.<br/>
On to salt.  Moderation works for me.  I love it and have several different varieties in my pantry. My blood pressure is on the low side and proper use of salt in my diet (never its omission) is essential to my well-being.

Currently, working people and their employers each pay 6.2% Social Security taxes on the first $113,700 in wages.  The maximum SS tax anyone pays is $7,049.  If you make less than the cap, you pay the maximum 6.2%.  The more you earn above the cap, the smaller the percentage of your wages it represents.   If you’re an average Wall Streeter earning $340,000, your SS taxes amount to less than 2% of your income.  <br/><br/>In the past, 95% of all wage income was subject to SS taxes.  That percentage has been dropping for years.  My theory is that the reason the cap has not been scrapped is that the financial industry, which has a disproportionate number of high-wage earners doesn't want to pay its match.  At the same time, if the system is solvent for twenty more years, why increase the tax now when we all know that Congress cannot keep its collective hands out of the cookie jar? <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.cheesefoodnation.com"" title=""http://www.cheesefoodnation.com"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cheesefoodnation.com</a>",,6,Left Coast,False,40112566,1365434749

Some time ago, moneyed interests began to be successful at dismantling unions and then began sending middle class jobs overseas. We know why: to make more money; increasingly merged corporations became obsessed with their bottom lines, stock prices, and executive compensations, ignoring the moral obligations and social contracts many of their businesses once honored. We didn't do much to counter these things because:1) some of the larger unions became caricatures of themselves; engaged in serious overreach, tarnishing the union brand; and 2) we benefited from the higher stock prices corporations were earning through our (often union-negotiated) pension plans and other investments; we like it when we watch our mutual funds steadily gain in value.  The middle class is now without union representation and with few job options and therefore without political power; once supported by unions, congressional Democrats now compete with Republicans for corporate support leaving few in Congress to fight for middle class workers, leaving us adrift with few options and increasingly in despair.

No risks in commercial banks during the crisis? Are you kidding me? Sure, the repeal of Glass-Steagall cannot account for all crisis-era risk-taking, but it certainly played a role, as part of a broader deregulation scheme, in providing diversified financial behemoths access to enormous amounts of cash with which they made heedless, speculative investments, all in the name of fattening their year-end bonus pools. Senator Warren is clearly not the only one who ""prefers sweeping, overly broad pronouncements about complex issues while ignoring their nuances."" (Indeed, that statement itself is but a sweeping, overly broad pronouncement that ignores any nuances!) Likewise, if you accuse Warren of pandering to the emotions of the populist set, what exactly was your point of Mr. Cohan mentioning that Mr. Weiss's mother received an e-mail opposing her son's nomination? Of course, no mention in the article that Weiss would receive a $20 million parting gift from his former employer upon taking the Treasury post. Is anyone supposed to believe that that sort of windfall will have no effect on Weiss's decision-making in the public sector?

At the same time, inversions often entail significant upfront tax costs to both the company being inverted and its shareholders. Instead, she would do better by going after the 15% capital gains tax rate on carried interest which is truly egregious.<br/>However, she is right to want to re-inact Glass Stegall Cohan's point that the risks that arose on Wall Street prior to 2008 resided primarily with investment banks is of course utterly false as I believe B of A, Citigroup and other traditionally-commercial banks were bailed out because of their positions in CDS's and other instruments associated with real estate which they in turn financed using FDIC-insured deposits.

2074,"I never thought I would be saying this, but finally Obama does something for this country and not for political gain. Good for him! Already the lead economist at Moody's is predicting more economic growth for next year, as are economists for JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Now if the two clowns in charge of the House and Senate don't mess it this deal up, we should get a strong start for 2011! Oh, yes, Paul Krugman doesn't like the deal, but then he has advocated for death panels and a higher stimulus which would only have been even more wasted money than we already spent for no positive response.",,0,anywhere,False,59944009,1291771849

2076,"I suppose the President opted for the ""better than nothing"" wisdom.<br /><br />To his ideological base, this may look like a sellout. But for the millions of low-income middleclass who are struggling to meet ends meet, and the millions who are jobless for no fault of their own and who are uncertain where the next food is going to come from, President Obama's pragmatic decision is a big bonus of relief!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it is more a question of bread and butter than pledge and principle. The latter can wait for another day to be fulfilled and honored!<br />",,0,Auckland,False,55305318,1291767379
2077,"Having just watched our President address the Nation. I am just so proud of this man and so glad that he is our leader in these trying times. President Obama has once again cut through the garbage that is Washington politics and done the right thing for the American people. This good man acts from his heart and shows more Christianity than ninty percent of the Faux Right Wing Christians who love to judge and critisize him. Those on the left are also guilty of not having the moral convictions to back our President when he transcends politics to do what he knows is right. When millionair left wing politicians and celebrities turn their backs on our President and think that left wing priciples count more than the economic survival of working class and unemployed Americans, they become as shallow as the greedy misers of the far right . I choose to stand with my President. You President Obama are not just a good man and a fine Christian American. You are also becoming more every day, one of our greatest American Presidents.

2078,"Proffy Peek-A-Boo -- The Republicans Party voted to make tax rates unpredictable by passing tax cuts that expired.<br /><br />Then they predicted jobs would follow and they didn't.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the CBO predicted huge deficits and they were correct.<br /><br />Now your party is in the process of agreeing to another trillion in deficit spending...as usual.<br /><br />In comment #37, Steve Bolger gives you a real economic contingency: low tax rates leading to higher income as a disincentive to invest in productive capacity, especially when one can put the money in commodities, foreign ETFs, derivatives, currency trades, and MBSs instead and pay only capital gains tax rates. Why, for instance, would I put my money into a business when my other investments pay better, are las liquid as possible, and are taxed at a lower rate?<br /><br />Hey, everyone, it's crickets time.",,2,Ann Arbor,False,59793377,1291753827
2079,"Moe--Come on, think that through with me.  The country dumps House 63 Democrats in November.  The President and Senate leadership agree to extend tax cuts in December.  The lame duck Democrats in the House, about to become a minority, then refuse to extend the cuts.  Then in January, the Minority Leader finds her new desk is--in the street!  Meanwhile, the new House majority then re-enacts the cuts and maybe takes out one or two of the Democrats' goodies, which the shrunken Democrat majority in the Senate then falls all over itself to agree with.<br /><br />Come on!  Your plan is a good way to get what's left of the Democrats roasted alive!",,2,San Francisco,False,15795216,1291751564
2080,"Bob Royfills -- Um, no.<br /><br />First, many of us are advocating for an end to all of the Bush tax rates. All of them, Bob, not a 'cut the deficit at someone else's expense' plan.<br /><br />Second, there were any number of scenarios in which delaying this vote could have worked to the Democrats advantage, one of which was holding no votes at all until next year and then turning the filibuster tables on the Republicans. On all of these issues -- repeal of DADT, ending the tax cuts for the rich, extending UI for 99ers, ratifying START -- the Democrats enjoy overwhelming support, and they could have passed them all by standing tough for a while and calling the Republicans Party bluff when the electorate got fed up.<br /><br />But I'll maintain what I said above: any scenario I could outline was a moot point because Obama is getting precisely the appeal to Independents he believes is a wise move. He fully expects the base to accept his deal. A White House spokesman said just that earlier today. Kabuki, Bob, kabuki.",,1,Ann Arbor,False,59793377,1291749432
2081,Obama's Marxist socialist agenda is showing itself.  He bargained to keep the tax cuts unpredictable.  He thinks that in 2012 he can talk a majority of us into harming the rich to benefit ourselves.  The reality of the situation is that this decision will lead to continued high unemployment.  Taking money away from our employers and investors and giving it to government beneficiaries will never turn around our economy.,,2,"Laguna Niguel, CA",False,56806063,1291748777

2083,It is now up to the Democrats in Congress to reject the ruinious compromise en masse. The foundation of the Democratic Party rests upon its base which is crumbling and will crack and erode if it compromises its core principles. This kind of transformation no one politician is worth. Obama is hurting the Democratic Party now and the sooner Democrats realize this the better for them and the rest of America. ,,3,VA,False,60083074,1291745409
2084,"I'd appreciate it if someone would address the small business thing.  Supposedly extending the tax cuts for the rich helps small businesses.  What I thought is that we are taxed on our net profits -- what the small business owner would take home with him/her.  So business expenses would be not taxable and would be deducted from gross profits.  So if a small business owner pays salaries, benefits, cost of running the store and then has $250,000 left over, the small business owner is taxed on the $250,000.<br /><br />What is wrong with that?",,4,NY,False,1670692,1291745195
