0,"Why is it implied that it is ""either-or"" for the Democratic presidential nomination?  Why should Joe Biden need to wait until the Hillary contingent and/or the Democratic Party executives decide that Hillary won't run, so it is okay for Joe Biden to run?We already have Sanders, O'Malley (not that he gets any media attention) and Chafee in the Democratic presidential running.  What's wrong with Joe participating in Democratic primaries too?If Hillary is afraid she can't beat these guys in her own party, and one of these candidates could do a better job in debates and the polls, then she won't be a viable challenger to the Republican nominee for president.  Let us see who does the best job and polls the most primary votes.The worse thing that could happen is that the Democrats will lose the presidency too.  Imagine a Republican House, Senate, Supreme Court, and Presidency and what that would bring for this country.Run Joe run!!  Putting Elizabeth Warren on the ticket as VP sounds like a great idea too.  "
1,"Glad you are addressing the ""DELUSION"" of Biden.  I feel like you did not go far enough.    As a female voter, I find he is supported by all the middle/upper middle class white males and is part of the old boys network...besides being too middle of the road and voting like a Republican. Yes, he appeals to the good old family guy in white America...but hello....demographics have changed. It is also very sexist how they dramatize him as being some ""savior"" if Sec. Clinton falters...as if she is some ""weak"" female. I am totally for Sen. Bernard Sanders...but totally feel this sexism towards Clinton. Let's not forget his attitude at the Anita Hill hearings.Why does everyone, including the press, have to use grief and getting over death as a playing card for Biden? WE ALL have our grief in life...especially old women!Just cause people feel sorry for him and he is a ""good guy"" has nothing to do with policies and where one stands on issues.Sen. Sanders did not vote for war, crosses all demographics (even though the fluff writing of Mr. Kohn and Mr. Horowitz try to snuff that), and he is enormously popular with the masses. Corporate media does not seem to get what is going on in this country and the world. Go, Bernie, go!!"
2,"I don't think Biden will run, but if Dems are worried that Hillary won't stay the course, they should look to Bernie Sanders, instead of letting Hillary supporters destroy him with false information.  Just now on Meet the Press, Chris Matthews did it again, distorting Bernie's record.  Bernie has said repeatedly he is a Democratic Socialist not a Socialist.  But there was Matthews fusing Bernie with pure socialism when as he went about defining the term (when Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who on Matthews' show last week said she wouldn't let Bernie give a prime time speech at the convention, ducked even discussing the term).  Bernie wants Medicare for everyone, and we have Medicare now.  If Medicare is pure socialism (as Matthews is painting Bernie with his broad brush), then we already have socialism and everyone here is apparently content with it.  People need to stop distorting what Bernie represents; otherwise the Dems, if they do go down with Hillary, will have brought it on themselves, discarding Bernie (who Matthews last week said he just couldn't see in the White House) when they should be considering Bernie Sanders as a very good candidate and just maybe a much safer bet than Hillary."
3,"I like Joe Biden, and think it is too late to get into a campaign even if everything else in his life were in order.  This would be too much to ask his family to go through at this time. "
4,"With all due respect to Senators Clinton and Sanders, Vice-President Biden brings experience, directness and compassion to the process. He would make a very good President. I hope he does run. He would have my full support."
5,"A Joe Biden run would effectively be a third Obama term. Is America so happy with Obama that they would want a third term? Based on Obama's approval numbers, America seems to be saying no. For the GOP currently confused about how to run against Hillary Clinton, a Biden run makes their job very easy; run against Obama and tie Biden to all the ""bad"" policies of Obama. Biden becomes Obama III. I don't think even many democrats who voted Obama want to see that. "
6,"It's not Joe, it's all the people who want to bring Hillary down that's the problem. If you can keep them from Joe's ear, he wouldn't even think about it."
7,"""No one should expect a free ride for Clinton. But she certainly deserves a fair shake.""Ms. Sullivan, I thank you for writing this article, and I believe you are being sincere.  Yet, within the past three hours, I received a NYT alert of Maureen Dowd's undignified article where she is promoting the candidacy of VP Joe Biden. An hour or so later, I received an alert that because of sympathy he has received, the VP is seriously thinking about entering the race.I do not believe in that much coincidence Ms. Sullivan.  A week ago, the NYT could not impede Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign by fabricating a ""criminal"" investigation. Now, it appears Mr. Baquet, Mr. Purdy, et al have a new strategy - i.e., one week later the NYT will use its power to promote a new candidate whom they think could defeat her candidacy.It is deja vu all over again at the NYT, but I do not think it is 2008.  I hope that women, and even the supporters of Bernie Sanders will see that the NYT has no right to act like Fox News!"
8,"Friends of Vice-President Biden's tenderly worry to media behind his back? Same friends, do tell his front. Skip the media middle. It looks Fox fakey, almost swiftboaty."
9,"I will vote for Clinton if she's the Democratic nominee, but I don't think she can win.  Democrats should get behind Biden, Sanders, and O'Malley."
