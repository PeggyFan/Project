Linear combination of features

Let matrix V be the product of the matrices W and H,

\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{W} \mathbf{H} \,.
Matrix multiplication can be implemented as computing the columns vectors of V as linear combinations of the column vectors in W using coefficients supplied by columns of H. That is, each column of V can be computed as follows:

\mathbf{v}_i = \mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}_{i} \,,
