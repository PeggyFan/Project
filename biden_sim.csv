They don't want to hear that her top three donors make her complicit with a plutocracy/oligarchy model by association.  Nor do they wish to hear that she went on the record as being resoundingly supportive of fracking last December, or that her default reaction to many scenarios in the middle east would be to send in troops.  Americans do not want a candidate whose reaction to questions about their judgement is met with ""stonewalling"", and they certainly don't want a ""coronation"".  Sanders has gone to great lengths to define his campaign as a manifesto against the current status quo, which maintains a disparity of wealth and continuous autonomy for a small segment of the population.

I agree that Sanders will do well--and perhaps prevail-- in Iowa and New Hampshire.  After that, I'm as uncertain as anyone.The silver lining thus far is that Sanders' message is being heard and is being greeted enthusiastically.  In other words, the political pros may be writing Sanders off, but the voters aren't.  That and Sanders's fund-raising prowess to date ($15 million and counting) are hopeful signs for this young campaign.  If this trend continues, Sanders will help to shape the Democratic stance on the issues, whether or not he is the nominee: a successful outcome.Sanders' directness is bracing and-- unlike every other major party candidate-- he is forthrightly addressing the economic issues that concern most Americans.  Compared to Sanders, the other candidates are at best vapid.I also want to note that the Times's coverage of the Sanders campaign, while gradually improving, has been spotty and centered on whether Sanders can depose Clinton.

In fact, increasing the minimum wage does decrease the share of income going to (at least) the top 1% when you look at state-level data. Why is this? Because inequality is increasing because of a change in the relative bargaining power between workers and firms. As workers lose their bargaining power, the share of income going to the bottom 50% (or even bottom 90%) falls, and the share going to the top 1% rises.So what can be done? Increasing the minimum wage is certainly one way to increase workers' bargaining power by setting a wage floor.

Outside NYC, LA, SF, Chicago, DC, Seattle, Portland, and major university towns he’ll be a much tougher sell than Obama ever was. Why? First, the “S”-word.  Regardless of how reasonable his principles may sound when described, most far-suburban, exurban and rural voters (especially Boomers &amp; older) will hear the word “Socialist” and think “Commie” instead. (And if they don’t at first, FOXNews--their “trusted” news source--will certainly hammer it over and over again till that meme “takes”).Even more sadly, Sanders’ Judaism (however secular) will be a dealbreaker for most heartlanders. In 2000, numerous push-poll calls concerning Lieberman, at first neutral-sounding, ended with the question “Are you comfortable with someone who denies our Lord &amp; Savior Jesus Christ being a heartbeat away from the Presidency?” Our last non-Christian Pres. was Jefferson; and Obama’s declared Christianity may have reassured rural voters and thus saved his candidacy among them.

You have laid out no rationale for why you want the job other than the implication that it is your turn and you deserve it.You have made no efforts to reach the majority of your party's supporters, made little efforts to win the confidence, or even address the concerns, of people who should be your core supporters.  You are simply too cloistered; the only voices that reach you are those that have paid for that access. Your only hope to presidency is to wing it to the nomination and hope that the fear of Republicans compels folks to hold their noses and vote for you.

It didn't, of course - the American economy since the 1970s has been directed by conservative ""thinkers"" and politicians. The result has been a 19% decline in median male wages since 1970 and the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the rich in American history. In 1970 the top 0.1% held 10% of the wealth; they now hold close to 25%. The top 10% had 33%; they now have about 50%. Conservatives have long accused Democrats of waging class warfare against the wealthy, while in reality the conservatives started this class warfare, and it was declared by the wealthy on everyone else.Next, ""thinker"" Reihan Salan, who ""favors more restrictive immigration policy.""

Persons who continue to have land line phones tend to be older and / or live in areas with poor cell phone signal strength.If, as I suspect, Trump's bellicosity towards illegal immigration reflects the opinions of more people than polls indicate, we may indeed see efforts to end birthright citizenship and some kind of verification system to lock the undocumented out of the economy.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/opinion/gop-candidates-follow-trump-to-the-bottom-on-immigration.html,0.0,hellier,0.0,63535866.0,1440075202.0,0.0732661435786,0.2,1,1,0.546626984127,0.2,1,1,Biden,,Hellier,,

Then they won control of Congress in 2012 and there were a lot of warnings around the fact that now they wouldn't have anybody to blame. They ignored their own warnings and carried on with petty warfare against the President, accomplishing zero in government. They still ignored the warnings that they needed to watch out because they were unpopular with their own voters. So, for a very long time they've been carefully preparing the ground for the seed of a Donald Trump to plant itself and flourish on the fertile ground of their stupidity. Now it's happened and the GOP is faced with the truth. Their own voters hate them. That those voters believe Trump is the answer to their woes is mind-boggling but that’s irrelevant. He could be the dumbest wretch on the planet—and often he tops that list—and it wouldn’t matter.This is how much the GOP doesn’t understand its own voters: they’ll follow a candidate who wants to raise taxes on the wealthy. And under-taxing the wealthy is one of the GOP central tenets! Angry conservative voters who are incapable of real discernment, and a not very intelligent, racist, bombastic, cruel, narcissistic misogynist for President.

And it is regrettable that by swallowing this myth, the present leadership of the Democratic Party, embodied in the Democratic National Committee has, in election after election, shrunk from some of the party’s best traditions in order to keep up in the race for campaign cash, even to the extent of marginalizing and openly scorning what is described as its ‘left wing.’“That Sanders, given his background, is garnering huge crowds who shout his name with an enthusiasm reminiscent of the heyday of the People’s Party in the 1890s, radiates a special glow.

Mrs. Clinton has been inevitable before, of course. Yet, for some important reason back in 2008, voters just wouldn't let it happen. And given what the electorate already knows about her in this cycle, two words come to mind more than any others -- caveat emptor.So, right upfront, before the first debate, caucus or primary, there's a nagging question we simply can't avoid: What has she done over the last seven or eight years to make us trust her any more now than we did back then?",http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/07/07/can-bernie-sanders-beat-hillary-clinton-reporters-notebook/,2.0,New York,0.0,13201855.0,1436343608.0,0.140282287157,0.6,1,1,0.449733946609,0.6,1,1,Biden,NY,,42.1497,-74.9384

And he is demanding that regular Americans get a say in how our society is run, which, despite being the basis for our political system, is no longer the interest of so many of our political leaders. Our lives as individuals are organized based on the needs not of society as a whole but of powerful market actors. We don't have vacation time, maternity/paternity leave, affordable healthcare, because these powerful groups say it will hurt them. The people who hold the most sway over culture, our food, our environment, and increasingly, our education system, rarely care about the public good. Americans are understanding not only that the interests of this top 0.1 percent aren't the interests of everyone else, but that their interests are a big reason the rest of society is suffering. Bernie is giving hope to those of us who had worried it was too late for a politician to assert our needs--those of us who aren't wealthy enough to pay for the time of Hillary Clinton or any of the Republican candidates.

Children learn to accept the government enforced inequality that increases the housing values of one community and the tax rates in the other.The southern “wall” Mr. Trump, and too many others, want to build is just another form of zoning that makes it difficult for the poor but does not prevent the free movement of the middle class. When visitors overstay their welcome in the U.S., the “wall” is properly understood as folly. Why sneak in when you can visit and not go home? Some want a powerful political message that “your kind” is not wanted. Just try to buy or even rent in one of Mr. Trump’s neighborhoods. He does not design and build integrated communities.Ironically, the Trumpian approach is as appealing to wealthy Democrats as it is to wealthy Republicans. The poor can only be accepted if they know their place, follow the rules and idolize wealth with all available government policy. Imagine the possibilities if single family zoning was replaced by family freedom which allowed people of different races to share homes and apartments in one of Trump’s neighborhoods (without being one of the servants).",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/opinion/gop-candidates-follow-trump-to-the-bottom-on-immigration.html,28.0,"Massapequa Park, NY",1.0,65021610.0,1440081703.0,0.170923520924,0.8,1,1,0.571067821068,0.8,1,1,Biden,NY,Massapequa Park,42.1497,-74.9384

What has the net effect been?I have recently seen a rather extensive paper from the St. Louis FED that attempts to answer this question at least wrt to China.  says ""between 2000 and 2007, increased competition from Chinese imports reduced U.S. manufacturing employment by about 1 million jobs, but increased overall welfare by 0.2 percent in the short run and 6.7 percent in the long run, due to increased access to cheaper intermediate goods.""

Then JFK lowered the top brackets, not by re-indexing the system but by eliminating the top brackets. More brackets were eliminated by Reagan. Today the Upper Middle income earners are in the same bracket as the ultra wealthy but without the ability to manage their income so that they don't pay taxes like the top income earners in the same bracket (The same is true for business taxes). Any attempt to ""Tax the Rich"" slams the upper middle class and small businesses all because of the elimination of brackets.Re-instituting more brackets will raise a campaign against complicating taxes (actually the deductions are what complicate taxes).

While it almost always is characterized by a 'race to the bottom' in wages, that does not always need to be the case. As a case in  point, look no further than Germany, a country whose economy is highly export driven and one who has not experienced the deleterious effect on wages and employment that we are witnessing in the United States. There are three primary reasons for this:1) A strong unionized labor force. Union representation on the Board of Directors of every major corporation in Germany and union representatives work closely with corporate board members in setting the goals for the business.2) A strong social safety net.3) A functioning democracy rather than an oligopoly. While campaign spending is present, we are not talking of vast sums of money flooding the political process.

Sadly these paths are barely affordable to Americans and represent an extremely high barrier for children of unskilled immigrants, legal or otherwise.

Having said that, I will suggest that Scheiber is avoiding the main issue about inequality: is excessive inequality an economic issue (as opposed to a social issue) and, if so, is excessive inequality self-correcting? The historical evidence indicates that excessive inequality and financial instability are highly correlated, and that excessive inequality is self-correcting absent intervention by the government. What's the historical evidence? 1929 et seq. and 2007 et seq. Of course, the Fed didn't intervene in 1929 and inequality plummeted whereas the Fed did intervene in 2007 and inequality fell somewhat but soon recovered to the pre-crisis level. Am I suggesting that in the next financial crisis, that the Fed not intervene? I'm not crazy, just observant. Are we in for another financial crisis? Yes, if history is our guide. Will the Fed intervene as it did in 2007 et. seq.? Piketty believes so (he says so in his book). Me, I'm not as optimistic (or pessimistic depending on your point of view).

Their Pharisaical support of Kim Davis fits those whom Jesus decried, being people who liked to pray in public and to display their wealth in their synagogues to be seen of men. This behavior is also coupled with the Randian philosophy of demonizing the poor and finding ways to make their lot even more miserable when possible, hardly Christian behavior. Gibbons found early Christianity to have been one of the factors bringing about the fall of the Roman Empire, and certainly they are not lending much support to the regeneration of this nation with their stubborn adherence to ignorance. To quote Scripture, I find them to be empty sepulchers full of whited bones.  Their behavior daily confirms my choice to leave religion, especially Christianity, behind, since it is nothing more then another institution designed to prey on humanity and all of our insecurities.  A modern day Jew has recently taken them to task regarding their allegiance to these modern day Pharisees, but I doubt they'll listen, anymore than those who were presented with same message 2,000 years ago.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/opinion/have-evangelicals-who-support-trump-lost-their-values.html,2.0,"Burley, Idaho",0.0,64885538.0,1442501466.0,0.090025974026,0.8,1,1,0.487372294372,0.8,1,1,Biden,ID,Burley,44.2394,-114.5103
