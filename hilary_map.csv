If he were, charisma-wise, he would win, despite his age. He is authentic. He is straightforward and determined. But that isn't enough.Back in 2000, many just wanted to vote for Ralph Nader, not because he would win they thought, but they loved him so much, which blunted, even blinded their judgment. But it led to George W Bush's disastrous presidency. And even Sandra O'Connor regretted to rule to ""appoint"" GW Bush as president of the US. That's unlikely to repeat. For one thing, Sanders is not as intoxicated as Nader was. He said he would not be an obstructionist. He is unlikely to be a third party candidate.Unlike many think, both Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton are quite progressive. Their posture as ""moderate"" has been just practical to win elections. If Sanders surges, that will be cover for Clinton to pull left more than she would otherwise have. ",1.0,-92.302,38.4623

One thing I have to believe the country is hungering for is that the ""deadbeats"" in the majority and in control of the House and Senate actually get off their duffs and do something, for a change. Neither Hilary nor Bernie nor any Democrat, for that matter, in the White House will ever be able to get anything done if the ""do-nothings"" led by Boehner and McConnell hold on to power.

The fact she attended a women's college (I did too) means she was nurtured by faculty and fellow students to believe there was nothing a woman couldn't do.Like the author, I've heard stories that Clinton is far more personable in private than when she has her guard up in public.  I find that very believable and when I read she is adored by staff, I also believe that.But like many, I think she has to guard against seeming condescending: Leibovich didn't get into that aspect of how she comes across.  And the best way to do that, as he sort of points out, is to make the public more personal with stories, say, of her mother and what that signifies in her feelings about ""fighting"" for people.  If she can just link it more to policies that could have benefited her mother, and weave more into the fact that she's had some experience with people as hard up as they (her audiences), she would come across as more likeable.Hill will never be Bill.

Surviving this scenario requires her to run a relentlessly positive yet disciplined campaign, and accept the possibility that she could legitimately lose - and be ok with that.However, if Hillary alienates the progressive wing of the party, and the GOP sells out the anti-immigration wing of its party, thus energizing a Trump third party run, then a credible scenario will exist for the 2016 Presidential race to end up in the electoral college - and only God knows how that would end, and what America would like once it was over.",1.0,-74.9384,42.1497

His crass celebration of personal wealth as the meaning of life is an uncomfortable echo of the GOP's raison d'être. A veneer of decorum usually masks the GOP’s bankrupt principles; Trump’s crude explication of those principles strips the veneer; no longer masked, the GOP’s core values are revealed for the entire world to see. It’s horrific – especially when combined with that Trump hair.Similarly, what really concerns Democratic Party leaders is that Bernie Sanders is not in their control; Sanders is in a race to restore the Democratic Party. His 12-step “Agenda for America” is nothing more than an expression of traditional Democratic principles. But, by stating them so eloquently, and speaking about them so passionately, he exposes just how far those who lead the party have strayed from those principles since Bill Clinton began triangulating them into oblivion and selling what remained of the party’s soul to Wall Street and corporate elites. Seen in that light, Hillary’s kowtowing to elite interests is made uncomfortably transparent by Sanders, and the Democratic Party’s abandoning of its core values is revealed for the entire world to see.

Hillary's life has been filled with scandals that are created entirely by Republican fiction writers.  In spite of two decades of investigation, no charges have been leveled against her.

Hillary was able to facilitate that kind of negotiation when she was in the Senate.  She will do it very well as President. The negativity against Hillary, doesn't just come from the Republicans.
